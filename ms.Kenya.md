Background
============

Normative beliefs is a prominent proxy to predicting behaviors [].  Evidences showed strong correlations of what people believe and how they expect to behave in response to their believes [], from xxx [], xxx[], to xxx[] (tattoo, substance use, social norms influence intentions to receive HPV vaccination in differnt cultural contexts [ZhanZhan20] decision; sexual risk behabvior [BasaChri19], alcohol and substance use [AARN16,EiseToum14,...]...).  Some beliefs are deemed as positive in behavior changes, such as xxx[], others negative, such as xxx[].  The norms we embedded can values we perceived of what people do and what people expect us to do. Norm in most cases is a collection of group beliefs [], and people abide it whether they agree on it or not.  Female genital cutting is an example which received significant amount of studies and debates.

Would social norm explain the traditional persistence of female genital cutting in various part of the world, especially in Africa []? 


=====
Female genital cutting (FGC) is a procedure which alters, injurs or completely remove of female's genitalia for non-medical reasons [Momo17, UNIC21].  It is a violation of human rights with an irreparable consequences [], while the practice was partly deemed as part of a girl’s initiation into embedded normative womanhood [UNFP24].  An eradication of FGC was a common goal among the international community [].  There would be more than 230 millions of women and girls in the world with any form of FGC by 2024, mostly in Africa and the Middle East [UNIC24].  A zero new cases of FGC by 2030 was proposed [], but is not likely to achieve because of rooted traditional, religious and cultural circumstances of FGC, in high FGC prevalence communities [] and beyond, as found in immigrated groups situated in a western society [OdukAfol17] where FGC is rarely practiced and deemed with negative public images []. We adapted FGC instead of circumcision or multilation due to confusion and dissatisfaction from the later two terms [Tost15, UNFP24].

The thousand year old ancient practice [KoubMuas85] has been extensively studied.  Besides concerns of human rights violations and health impact [WHO16, Will18...], the research mostly examined its normative embodiment to understand the dynamics of FGC practice [](systematic review references). One of the original research presented FGC as a marriageability convention [Mack96], then to a broader social expectations, such as social prestige, adolescent rite of passage, and female honor and modesty [Mack96, Mack00, MackLeJe09]. The behavior was viewed as a result of a social coordination for social acceptance and recognition (for example, see [BiccMari15, BoylMcMo02, Hayf05, GrosHayf19, KandMwek09, Mack96, MataEeke23, Momo17, Powe17]) and religious requirement [GreiBarn20]. The reasons are interconnected.  Some studies also looked at if modernization [] and gender awareness [] contributed to eradicating the practice. FGC was found in countries where social and economic conditions were worse but no clear link between the fundamental situations and the abandonment of the practice was found; it was social expectations that mattered [BiccMari15].

Why do people do what they do despite social defiance? Social norms are behavioural rules that individuals prefer to follow on believing that
others follow the rule, and/or are expected by others to follow the rule [Peti19].  The meanings of FGC values were perceived differently within communities; for example, young males showed stronger positions in maintaining the practice while their elders and females held different and more flexible attitudes [Miya23].  FGC is more a result of a community expectation than merely a personal choice.  In questioning the persistence of the practice, the normative approach tried to entangle how FGC beliefs bound the community, strengthen its group identify and preserve its religious requirement and gender purity (wording?)[].  There were various social advantages of FGC in a community where FGC was expected, such as group support [WandShel20], respect within their social groups [OmigBell22, ShelWand11, WandShel20] and recognition of group identity [CoynCoyn14], and avoidance of the ongoing socially psychological suffering for not being cut [OmigBell22].  Even outside a traditional setting, community normative expectation of FGC were observed in migrants in spreaded geological areas [AbidRamn22, VanOrte16]. It implied a sense of disopra [AbidRamn22].  Yet, that why community norms of FGC persist for centuries remains puzzled [].  A heterogeneous thresholds might not happen in a community with high FGC prevalence and a FGC norm change not guaranteed at a tipping point [EffeVogt15, Nova20] (CF to elaborate).

More research have weighted community influence on FGC persistence (e.g., []). In this study, we incorporated gender awareness [], in addition to community factor, to examine normative attitudes of FGC practice individually and collectively. This study compared changes of FGC attitudes over time based on the analysis of two sets of Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).  To our knowledge, this was the first quasi longitudinal study using quantitative FGC normative questions of DHS to examine norms priority and changes by accounting gender awareness, community backgrounds and FGC prevalence.  Kenya is one of the countries experienced clear drop of FGC practices over the decades [].  It made the Kenya FGC data a good case to comprehend the patterns of FGC norms through time.  Hopefully, this study could add some perceptions of the FGC obstinacy.


Research Questions
=================

There were two main research questions in this study:  first, what is the association of mothers' FGC beliefs and daughter's FGC future over time?  Secondly, what is the association of woman's FGC beliefs and FGC continuance over times?  They were tested with a daughter future model and a continuance model, respectively. In addition, we also tested a structural model, named a persistence model, to examine how woman's views of FGC future and their decision on daughters' FGC future together associate with their FGC status and beliefs. \cfcmt{I don't really understand how the theory works on the thrid model but feel it makes sense...}.  We tested the persistence model to further understand how the position of the daughter future model could be changed (or mediated/moderated?) under mother's attitude on FGC continuance.

data-and-sample-selection
=================
=================

The secondary data of women aged 15-49 from the Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of 2008 and 2022 were analyzed.  The FGC prevalence in Kenya decreased over years and were \% in 2008 to \% in 2022 [UNIC16]; Kenya DHS offered a rare view of the FGC belief changes over time since only a few countries were surveyed with the DHS quantified FGC norm modules {for FGC module see \url{https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSQMP/DHS5_Module_Female_Genital_Cutting.pdf}} in various years.  Although it was a quasi longitudinal comparison, the results would be valid. The daughter future model and the persistence model analyzed only women who had daughters to be considered for cutting.  The continuance model included all the women in the datasets.

Measurements
==========
==========

The main response variable were daughter's FGC future and FGC continuance for the daughter model and the FGC future model respectively. Compared to attitudes, intentions was a better predictor of behaviour [ArmiConn01].  The main predictors included woman's FGC beliefs, gender awareness and FGC status.  For the structure model, we tested two response variables, daughters' FGC future status and FGC future predicted by the same predictors as in the two main model.  
The FGC benefits were scored \cfcmt{pls confirm] to show the strength of FGC beliefs associating with FGC practice.  The FGC benefits and gender awareness were also quantified using average score \cfcmt{pls confirm]for the same reason.

The basic co-variables were country, education, job, residence (rural vs. urban), ethnicity, religion, marital status, age, media use, and wealth.  Media use (and wealth?) was quantified.  Cluster ID (i.e., villages where the samples were from) was treated as a random variable.  Gender awareness served as a proxy interacted with woman's intention to cut their daughters and their position on FGC practice overall [BoylSvec19].


\cfcmt{Do we consider all three types of FGC prevalence in the models:  national, community and Mother's status?}

Regarding community normative influence, the following factors were also tested at a community level:  mothers' intention on cutting daughters, FGC continuance, FGC benefits, FGC prevalence and gender awareness as well as education, wealth, and media use \cfcmt{ethnicity or not?}.  Also, cluster was treated as a proxy to represent a community level of impact [AliaRen06, HayfGarv20, KohlBehr00, Krav02].

\cfcmt{"Some factors that may affect FGC could not be tested because of data limitations. In some communities, ethnic divisions ... could be influential in the perpetuation of FGC.... We could not capture these things in our statistical models"[BoylSvec19]).  "For maternal ethnicity, we include all ethnic groups except in Côte d'Ivoire. In that country, the DHS provides a collapsed ethnicity variable combining over 60 ethnic groups into five broad categories.. [HayfGarv20].   Although [Hayf05] treated ethnicity as random in the Kenya 1998 study, that seemed the only one if it was used at all.}

\cfcmt{Should we explain how we dealt with a cluter where the sample was too small?}

\cfcmt{Bayesian model [KandNwak09] “Conversely, one cannot assume that the clusters selected in each district are fully representative of the states in which they are located because surveys only attempted to generate a fully representative sample at the regional level. Consequently, the spatial analysis will be affected by some random fluctuations.  Some of this random variation can be reduced through structured spatial effects because it includes neighboring observations in the analysis. However, it should be pointed out that such a spatial analysis should preferably be applied to census data, where the precision of the spatial analysis would be much higher." (p. 788)]

Statistical Model
=================
=================

The research questions were tested with cumulative link mixed models (CLMMs) in the statistics package R [Rstats,Rpackage_ordinal].  The CLMM framework analyzes a binary or ordinal response variable (i.e., whether to continue FGC practice and intention of cutting daughters), while treating clusters as a random effect.  
We subtracted respondent (-1) from the cluster when testing the community effect \cfcmt{Please rewrite this. Also, do we need to mention how we treat some clusters which had only one sample (if that happens).}
\cfcmt{Please explain why we didn’t do sampling weight.} "Multivariate models do not include weights because the DHS does not release the cluster-level sampling weights necessary for estimating weighted multilevel models" [HayfGarv20]
\cfcmt{Do we explain conveyance of uncertainty}

\cfcmt{Do we do any within-community variation and between-community variation?  Is it a thing?

results
========

The positive impact modernization [BoylMcMo02, Youn02] and gender/feminist perspectives [BoylSvec19, DalaLawo10, Dell04, FrieMahm13, KandNwak09, Lewi04, Meye00, Njam04, YirgKass12, Youn02] on intention of cutting daughters were not obvious than the convention approach in our findings as well as previously concluded [Hayf05] \cfonly{to confirm]. While a daughter’s FGC risk was higher if she was in a community with a higher community-level of women’s extra familial opportunities (e.g., education, paid work and marital background) [GrosHayf19], our findings showed that community level of education was not a clear determinant of daughter’s FGC risk, compare to a previous study showed that community education had no clear effect on the likelihood of daughter’s FGC future, while the individual education did in Kenya [Hayf05].

Regarding FGC continuity, education and wealth (both individual and community level) were clearly correlated with attitudes towards FGC continuation in our findings.  While both wealth level and education of community level had a positive association with FGC discontinuation (i.e., the higher the education and wealth level were, the less likely to support FGC practice in the future), individual education had an opposite correlation; the results was compared to what was observe in Sierra Lion where both individual level of educate and wealth were positively associated with support of FGC abandonment [Sagn14], and to Egpyt [DalaLawo10, VanMeek16]. A secondary analysis of the Egypt DHS from 1995 to 2014 showed a positive correlation of individual level of education, job and wealth with their attitudes of FGC continuity [VanMeek15] .  It is also important to engage community and religious leaders to understand the need for change and to generate a transformation within the culture [KleiHelz18].  It is also important to think about how FGC is different from male circumcision and whether a safe medical service is possible [GrueEarp20, Joha22, KimaShell18, RoveUlri22].

It is noticed that the patterns of FGC benefits based on the PCA results \cfcmt{M: PCA figures] indicated that benefits of FGC was not as clearly elaborated as the benefit module categorized.  The main index was grouped as others.  It means that the main reasons of why mothers intended to cut their daughters or what they believe was the real benefits/reason was not clearly stated. It could be reasons aforementioned as, for example, peer convention [GrosHayd19CONFIRM, ShelWand11].  Further field research is recommended to further clarify reasons of cutting.

Although FGC prevalence was a main factor predicting daughter’s FGC status [BoylSvec19] \cf{more cites], we found that overall community intention explained more variance than FGC prevalence on respondents’ intention of cutting daughters cfonly{ show daughter effect plot]:  What their community members will do is likely to determine what a mother intends to do with their daughters’ FGC status. In this case, what people did (descriptive norm?) was less a force than what they will do.  In other words, - descriptive norm (i.e., FGC prevalence) was undermined by subjective norm (community intentional behaviour of . \cf{One confusing finding is that all the three models showed group fgc benefits are robustly and negatively associated with the responses.].  Norms sustained through communications and evolve through social interactions [FishAjze10, RimaLapi15].   There are conventional roots in FGC practice [FreyJohn07, Hayf05, KandShel19, Mack96, ShelWand11] which may evolve into various forms of conventional norms, such as peer convention [GrosHayd19CONFIRM, ShelWand11] (more)


"modernisation-related factors were stronger predictors of abandonment attitudes than of FGC status" [GreiBarn20] (more), our findings support (or not)?
A systematic review showed that "A lower level of maternal education, family history of FGM/C, or belonging to the Muslim religion (in certain contexts) increased the likelihood of FGM/C. The majority of studies that examined higher paternal education (for girls only) and living in an urban region showed a reduced likelihood of FGM/C, while conflicting evidence remained for wealth. Several studies reported that FGM/C literacy, and low community FGM/C prevalence were associated with a reduced likelihood of FGM/C." [ElFaro22]

"wealth index, education level, history of circumcision, and regional variation are associated with women's attitude towards discontinuation of the practice of FGM in Ethiopia. " [AhmeSeid22]

Norms can be rooted in what one thinks, passively or actively, others think which can be based on one's action or the communication. Change should be coordinated among interrelated members of social networks [Mack96, Mack00, MackLeJe09, ShelWand11]

FGM/C is practiced as part of the initiation into a secret society in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

— Suggestions —

- How to adverse the health consequence:  Can FGC be abolished/contained?
- vs. MC
- Qualitative research to gather more elaborated answers of benefits of FGC
- More options of FGC benefit module is suggested.
- family dynamics are relevant to gain support to end female genital cutting”[Hayf06]
- " the grounds for a growing critical consensus that current anti-FGM laws and policies may be ethically incoherent, empirically unsupportable, and legally unsustainable."[EarpJohn20]
- Involve elders and traditional leaders to address the issue of those who wish not to participate in the cutting practice [ChegAske04, more]

Changes of social norms in public health behaviours may require a few steps:  motivation, deliberation and action [CislHeis18a].  An alternative to fgc (e.g., a complete stop or a symbolic pricking) will have to provide motivation and facilitate the change of behaviour; the behavioural change will have to be a social action (i.e., gaining recognition and public participation within community) since fgc is a social norm;  and a public commitment to change in hope for reaching a critical mass needed to dismantle the normative behaviour. (using Tostan as an example) (also see [Youn15].  Promising change are observed in changing norms [EvanSnid19] (and Tostan).  How to foresee a community conducive to certainty for girls without fgc?

Unlike foot binding which was displayed in public, the outcome of FGC can only be identified through private channels (e.g., a tight group community or personnel communications).  The intervention of FGC via public rejection or condemnation is more questionable (or challenging, especially when if marriage is no longer a main reason for FGC).  While the comparison of foot binding had a public norm effect, the difference between FGC and no FGC is more personal.  A bottom-up campaign empowering local community and engaging women in change of the practice is essential [BergDeni13b] and messages tailoring differences of normative beliefs in different groups should also be considered.  The practice of FGC is likely to be revised due to types of FGC, but how to eradicate it if it evolves to just a “nick” compared to the norm of male circumcision as a state of identity [Earp15, HanbEsse21, PalmElme23]?

- MC vs. FGC.  If MC is an ethnic identity among Jewish community and is overall accepted around the world, can FGC be granted for a similar value if it is just a "nick?"
Considering the acceptance of Alternative rights of passage [GaluKama15] without criminalize the practice. (I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this position, but it is an alternative.) vs. focused on empowerment, and campaigns to recruit change agents from within communities (to eradicate FGC) [ShelHern13, Will18]; medicalizing FGC [LeyeVanE19]
- modelling by plotting empirical data to study threshold/tipping point.
- redesign questions of fgc benefits in DHS
- inviting faced women migrated to western society to participate in fgc intervention campaign.  For example,  attitude change: "migrating to and living in Sweden facilitates a transition in attitudes regarding FGC" [WahlJohn17], and initiating “participatory campaign and education”  (an idea from [MackLeJe09]’s “participatory human rights education” and Boston’s), including women’s empowerment and horizontal involvement (vs. trickle-down strategy)
- [MackLeJe09]”coordinated community abandonments (Dagne 2008, http://www.kmgselfhelp.org/hotissues.html). Both human rights deliberation and coordinated community abandonment are necessary for change. National programmes in Egypt and Sudan are promoting positive human rights messages and discussions at national, regional, and local levels, and are experimenting with a variety of coordinated abandonment through community dialogue efforts at the local level. “ (use [Dagn09, MackLeJe09] for this idea)
- a bottom-up intervention aimed at changing social expectation [BiccMari15]
- Instead of focusing on improving knowledge and changing attitudes, we need to be more cautious about implementation of social norm interventions and infuse intervention in a relational dimension and a dynamic framework [CislHeis18a, CislHeis18b, McCh15].  Empowering local community and opinion leaders in implementing “organized diffusion” [MackLeJe09]has proven cost-effective [CislDenn19]. (and Boston?)

[Cami15]: “ interventions against FGC, rather than leading to the abandonment of the practice, can have unintended and potentially harmful effects on the way FGC is performed.”

- Any questions can be added to the DHS fgc module to gather more relavent and udpated reasaons why continue FGC?


-- Limitation --
While beliefs of FGC benefits was a clear factor associating with women’s intention of cutting their daughters, our findings could not clarify what benefits exactly the women believed?  As proposed that social norm and the behavior it compels cannot be inferred from personal attitude [Mack18] (in rebuttal letter), a further analysis to entangle the FGC beliefs is expected.

- No FGC types relating to our response variables

- Not controlling for daughter’s age

- Not considering heterogeneity.
