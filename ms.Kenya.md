Background
=================
\hypertarget{Background}{%
\section{Background}\label{Background}}

Female genital cutting (FGC), circumcision or mutilation is a form of altering or injuring female's genitalia for non-medical reasons [Momo17, UNIC21].  While the exact prevalence might be underreported due to a deeply embedded local social-cultural practice that is mostly deemed illegal [StevKell22], it is estimated that at least 200 million women and girls are survivors of FGC in 2024 [Unit24], mostly in Africa and the Middle East and with most girls cut before the age of 15 [UNIC21].  FGC is embodied with dissension from cultural and religious identity in one end, and public health and human rights concerns on the other [AhmeKare18, BergDeni13a, Joha22, KhosBane17, Mack00, McCaBroe19, Momo17, LienSchu13, PalmElme23, RoveUlri22, TordBish22], as traditional norms vs. international norms [JohaAhme21].  The common international position of FGC is about abolishment than intervention [KhosBane17, Unit22].  While the goal towards zero new cases of FGC by 2030 was observed [Unit22], progress of intervention is impeded [TordBish22] because of the complicated FGC history [BergDeni12, Cami16] and of cross-border and transnational practices [Unit22].  Following Tostan [Tost15], we used cutting instead of circumcision or mutilation in this study without excusing the negative impact of the practice while recognizing a sense of self-awareness in making decision about FGC [JohnEsse10, KawoAllw22, Meye00, Shel01, Tost15].

Knowledge and attitudes in supporting FGC abolishment did not easily translate to abandon the practice [ChegAske04, Bicc10, Cami15, CislHeis18, McCaBroe19] \cfonly{less cites}, as FGC was morally embraced [SchuLien13] and deeply rooted in social-cultural expectations [Mack00, Hayf05, Momo17].  Unpacking social norm, a form of values driving behavioural patterns which are self-enforcing within a group [Youn15], is a crucial task in the intervention of FGC tradition [Bicc10, KawoAllw22, Mack96, MataEeke23, Momo17, Youn15] \cfonly{check andm update cites} in order to comprehend reasons and values attached to FGC and recognize the persistence of the practice [Bicc10, Cami15, CislHeis18, Youn15] \cfonly{update}.  Social convention theory, a leading theory probing FGC tradition (e.g., see [BoylMcMo02, BoylCorl10, FreyJohn07, FrieMahm13, Hayf05, KandMwek09, Mack06, MackLeJe09, ReigGonz14, YirgKass12] \cfonly{update}) initially proposed that FGC was a marriageability convention through coordination [Mack96] and later extended to broader social norms, such as social prestige, adolescent rite of passage, and female honour and modesty [Mack96, Mack00, MackLeJe09].  The theory, with some challenges [AgolRich20 EffeVogt15], lays a foundation of understanding and researching the complexity of FGC practice with its normatively rooted community [GutiSola22, Haye05].

The social convention theory regards FGC a social expectation of interdependent behavior among and coordinated by members in their social network as observed in various communities (for examples, see [GreiBarn20, Haye05, MackLeJe09, ShelWand11, WandShel20]) \cfonly{more cites}.  The normative factors have underlined women’s decisions of undergoing FGC [AlcaGonz13, ForsIsak21, GutiSola22, Hayf05, Mack09, PashPonn16, Rima08, ShelWand11] (update and more specific).  The conventional factors ranged from social advantages by showing respect to the authority of the cut elders [ShelWand11], to demonstrating appreciation to the tradition, feminine virtue, and group support [WandShel20], obeying religious requirement [GreiBarn20], and avoiding the ongoing socially psychological suffering [OmigBell22].  FGC was also viewed as a form of social and symbolic capital [Bour84], differentiated cut women from the uncuts for inclusion and respect within their social groups [OmigBell22, ShelWand11, WandShel20].  Beliefs of justifying FGC practice was as much rooted in cultural values as those against the cuts [DoucDela22], and strongly correlated with social expectation (i.e., what other people do or what other people believe one should do)[BiccMari15,MataEeke23] \cfonly{more cites}.  Basically, when FGC norms within the communities are strong, individuals tend to self-enforce and coordinate such norms [Ajze02, Hayf05, KandNwak09, KandShel19, Mack96, Mack06, MackLeJe09, ThomMadd92] \cfonly{add [Bicc15]]\cfonly{more cites}.

The normative conditions of FGC decision provides insights of the FGC continuum from the violation of human rights and ready to abandon the practice to support of the traditional FGC values, and ambivalent contemplations of the practice in between [EarpJohn20, GrueEarp20, Joha19, JohaAhme21, Leon20].  In this study, we analyzed types of social norms women attached to FGC individually and collectively.  Although there have been studies on FGC norms as aforementioned and analyses of FGC persistence using DHS data (such as  [AyenWol23, AzezWill20, TordBish22, YounCheo20]), there was limited clarification of types of individual normative attitudes (e.g., attitudinal position of FGC values) and behavioural intention in response to the community persistence.  We believe this is the first FGC study exploring quantitative modules of FGC normative attitudes to model the FGC intention by utilizing the norm in the context of community influence, and hope to extend understandings of the persistence of FGC practice.

\subsection{Data selection}\label{data-selection}}


We analyzed the secondary data of women aged 15-49 from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) when it met the research criteria:  countries with high FGC prevalence [UNIC16], and with the modules of FGC status, FGC benefit, and gender awareness. As a result, four countries of the most recent datasets were selected: Kenya 2008/9, Mali 2006, Nigeria 2008 and Sierra Leone 2008 \cfcmt{checked and updated in Nov 6, 2023.}   Although the datasets seemed outdated, it should not affect the study object to understand FGC norms and behaviors.  \cfcmt{See https://github.com/fishforwish/fgc/blob/master/README.md for updated info}.

Only women with daughters for FGC options were included in the the daughter model and the persistence model.   The continuance model included all the women in the datasets; and that resulted in xxx, xxx, xxx and xxx, and 7861, 13071, 18311 and 7231 in Kenya, Mali, Nigeria and Sierra Leon respectively.  \cfcmt{FGC module at \url{https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSQMP/DHS5_Module_Female_Genital_Cutting.pdf}}

\hypertarget{Measurements}{%

\cfonly{[Rima08]]}*

The main responses and predictors in the models are as: FGC benefits (predictor) -->  to FGC daughters (response) in the daughter model, FGC benefits --> FGC future in the continuance model, and FGC benefits and FGC continuance --> to FGC daughters in the persistence model.  The beliefs of FGC benefits were quantified using average score \cfcmt{pls confirm] to identify the strength of FGC beliefs associating with FGC practice.

The co-variables were basic social demographic factors (i.e., country, education, job, residence (rural vs. urban), religion, marital status, age, media use, and wealth) in addition to gender awareness [HayfGarv20, KandNwak09].  Gender awareness (see — for questions of gender awareness proxy) was included to test if women’s gender awareness interacted with their intention of FGC daughters and their position of FGC practice overall \cfonly{cite{Dell04, FrieMahm13,KhosBane17, Lewi95, Lewi09, Meye00, Morr08, Njam04, UNIC16, YirgKass12, Youn02, YounCheo20] check and cut].  Media use and gender awareness were also scored.  Cluster ID (i.e., villages where the samples were from) and ethnicity (see the list of ethnicity recode at table xx in appendix) \cfonly{with a footnote on how we recoded it] were treated as random variables.  Ethnicity was treated as a random effect based on previous study which showed little differences in results using individual rather than cluster ethnicity [Hayf05, HayfGarv20].

As FGC is deeply intertwined with group-level perception [Hayf05, HayfGarv20], the following factors were also tested at a community level:  mothers' intention on FGC daughters, FGC continuance, and FGC benefits as well as the basic social-demographic factors:  education, wealth, media use, gender awareness and FGC prevalence \cfcmt{to confirm:  it's on a cluster level, not national.  Correct?] with cluster as a proxy to represent a community level of impact [AligRen06, BoylSvec19, Hayf05, Krav02].
 
\cfcmt{Regarding FGC benefits modules, there were 9 questions.  Kenya had all the 9, Mali and SL 7 missing promiscuity and STD, NG 8 missing STD).  Should we drop STD since 3 out of 4 missed this variable?]
\jdcmt{Ideally, we would make ethnicity a random effect, but we are back to the Gilmour problem I guess.] \cfcmt{Ethnicity is an important factor (see Hayf05), more so than religion, associating with FGC status, and I don't think it shall be coded as a random factor.  But as J said, it is too hard! ] \cfcmt{Whatever we decide, we need a reason in this section to justify our decision. After all, ethnicity is better to be a fixed factor but we can’t because it breaks down the models!]

\cfcmt{“explicitly including ethnicity is a means of assessing another dimension of the collective aspect of circumcision behavior” [Hayf05]]
\cfcmt{Bayesian model [KandNwak09] “Conversely, one cannot assume that the clusters selected in each district are fully representative of the states in which they are located because surveys only attempted to generate a fully representative sample at the regional level. Consequently, the spatial analysis will be affected by some random fluctuations.  Some of this random variation can be reduced through structured spatial effects because it includes neighboring observations in the analysis. However, it should be pointed out that such a spatial analysis should preferably be applied to census data, where the precision of the spatial analysis would be much higher." (p. 788)]

\cfonly {in response to the degrees of modernization, conventional values and gender awareness within- and among-community (see [Achi14, BoylMcMo02, Hayf05, KandNwak09, ModrLiu13, Moor13, OdukAfol17, Youn02])}


\hypertarget{Statistical-Model}{%
\subsection{Statistical Model}\label{Statistical-Model}}

We used cumulative link mixed models (CLMMs) in the statistics package R [Rstats,Rpackage_ordinal] to analyze the models.  The CLMM framework allows us to model a binary or ordinal response variable (i.e., intention of applying FGC to daughters and whether to continue FGC practice), while treating clusters and ethnicity as random effects.  
We subtracted respondent (-1) from the cluster when testing the community effect \cfcmt{Please rewrite this. Also, do we need to mention how we treat cluster with only one sample (if that happens).}
\cfcmt{Please explain why we didn’t do sampling weight.}
\cfcmt{Do we explain conveyance of uncertainty}

\cfcmt{Our response ARE categorical not binary and need to explain how we quantify it into scores.; AND still need to explain why ethnicity is a random effect.}

\cfcmt{Do we do any within-community variation and between-community variation?  Is it a thing?

\section{Results}\label{results}}


The positive impact modernization [BoylMcMo02, Youn02] and gender/feminist perspectives [BoylSvec19, DalaLawo10, Dell04, FrieMahm13, KandNwak09, Lewi04, Meye00, Njam04, YirgKass12, Youn02] on intention of cutting daughters were not obvious than the convention approach in our findings as well as previously concluded [Hayf05] \cfonly{to confirm]. While a daughter’s FGC risk was higher if she was in a community with a higher community-level of women’s extra familial opportunities (e.g., education, paid work and marital background) [GrosHayf19], our findings showed that community level of education was not a clear determinant of daughter’s FGC risk, compare to a previous study showed that community education had no clear effect on the likelihood of daughter’s FGC future, while the individual education did in Kenya [Hayf05].

Regarding FGC continuity, education and wealth (both individual and community level) were clearly correlated with attitudes towards FGC continuation in our findings.  While both wealth level and education of community level had a positive association with FGC discontinuation (i.e., the higher the education and wealth level were, the less likely to support FGC practice in the future), individual education had an opposite correlation; the results was compared to what was observe in Sierra Lion where both individual level of educate and wealth were positively associated with support of FGC abandonment [Sagn14], and to Egpyt [DalaLawo10, VanMeek16]. A secondary analysis of the Egypt DHS from 1995 to 2014 showed a positive correlation of individual level of education, job and wealth with their attitudes of FGC continuity [VanMeek15] .  It is also important to engage community and religious leaders to understand the need for change and to generate a transformation within the culture [KleiHelz18].  It is also important to think about how FGC is different from male circumcision and whether a safe medical service is possible [GrueEarp20, Joha22, KimaShell18, RoveUlri22].

It is noticed that the patterns of FGC benefits based on the PCA results \cfcmt{M: PCA figures] indicated that benefits of FGC was not as clearly elaborated as the benefit module categorized.  The main index was grouped as others.  It means that the main reasons of why mothers intended to cut their daughters or what they believe was the real benefits/reason was not clearly stated. It could be reasons aforementioned as, for example, peer convention [GrosHayd19CONFIRM, ShelWand11].  Further field research is recommended to further clarify reasons of cutting.

Although FGC prevalence was a main factor predicting daughter’s FGC status [BoylSvec19] \cf{more cites], we found that overall community intention explained more variance than FGC prevalence on respondents’ intention of cutting daughters cfonly{ show daughter effect plot]:  What their community members will do is likely to determine what a mother intends to do with their daughters’ FGC status. In this case, what people did (descriptive norm?) was less a force than what they will do.  In other words, - descriptive norm (i.e., FGC prevalence) was undermined by subjective norm (community intentional behaviour of . \cf{One confusing finding is that all the three models showed group fgc benefits are robustly and negatively associated with the responses.].  Norms sustained through communications and evolve through social interactions [FishAjze10, RimaLapi15].   There are conventional roots in FGC practice [FreyJohn07, Hayf05, KandShel19, Mack96, ShelWand11] which may evolve into various forms of conventional norms, such as peer convention [GrosHayd19CONFIRM, ShelWand11] (more)

"modernisation-related factors were stronger predictors of abandonment attitudes than of FGC status" [GreiBarn20] (more), our findings support (or not)?
A systematic review showed that "A lower level of maternal education, family history of FGM/C, or belonging to the Muslim religion (in certain contexts) increased the likelihood of FGM/C. The majority of studies that examined higher paternal education (for girls only) and living in an urban region showed a reduced likelihood of FGM/C, while conflicting evidence remained for wealth. Several studies reported that FGM/C literacy, and low community FGM/C prevalence were associated with a reduced likelihood of FGM/C." [ElFaro22]

"wealth index, education level, history of circumcision, and regional variation are associated with women's attitude towards discontinuation of the practice of FGM in Ethiopia. " [AhmeSeid22]

Norms can be rooted in what one thinks, passively or actively, others think which can be based on one's action or the communication. Change should be coordinated among interrelated members of social networks [Mack96, Mack00, MackLeJe09, ShelWand11]

— Suggestions —

- How to adverse the health consequence:  Can FGC be abolished/contained?
- vs. MC
- Qualitative research to gather more elaborated answers of benefits of FGC
- More options of FGC benefit module is suggested.
- family dynamics are relevant to gain support to end female genital cutting”[Hayf06]
- " the grounds for a growing critical consensus that current anti-FGM laws and policies may be ethically incoherent, empirically unsupportable, and legally unsustainable."[EarpJohn20]
- Involve elders and traditional leaders to address the issue of those who wish not to participate in the cutting practice [ChegAske04, more]

Changes of social norms in public health behaviours may require a few steps:  motivation, deliberation and action [CislHeis18a].  An alternative to fgc (e.g., a complete stop or a symbolic pricking) will have to provide motivation and facilitate the change of behaviour; the behavioural change will have to be a social action (i.e., gaining recognition and public participation within community) since fgc is a social norm;  and a public commitment to change in hope for reaching a critical mass needed to dismantle the normative behaviour. (using Tostan as an example) (also see [Youn15].  Promising change are observed in changing norms [EvanSnid19] (and Tostan).  How to foresee a community conducive to certainty for girls without fgc?

Unlike foot binding which was displayed in public, the outcome of FGC can only be identified through private channels (e.g., a tight group community or personnel communications).  The intervention of FGC via public rejection or condemnation is more questionable (or challenging, especially when if marriage is no longer a main reason for FGC).  While the comparison of foot binding had a public norm effect, the difference between FGC and no FGC is more personal.  A bottom-up campaign empowering local community and engaging women in change of the practice is essential [BergDeni13b] and messages tailoring differences of normative beliefs in different groups should also be considered.  The practice of FGC is likely to be revised due to types of FGC, but how to eradicate it if it evolves to just a “nick” compared to the norm of male circumcision as a state of identity [Earp15, HanbEsse21, PalmElme23]?

- MC vs. FGC.  If MC is an ethnic identity among Jewish community and is overall accepted around the world, can FGC be granted for a similar value if it is just a "nick?"
Considering the acceptance of Alternative rights of passage [GaluKama15] without criminalize the practice. (I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this position, but it is an alternative.) vs. focused on empowerment, and campaigns to recruit change agents from within communities (to eradicate FGC) [ShelHern13, Will18]; medicalizing FGC [LeyeVanE19]
- modelling by plotting empirical data to study threshold/tipping point.
- redesign questions of fgc benefits in DHS
- inviting faced women migrated to western society to participate in fgc intervention campaign.  For example,  attitude change: "migrating to and living in Sweden facilitates a transition in attitudes regarding FGC" [WahlJohn17], and initiating “participatory campaign and education”  (an idea from [MackLeJe09]’s “participatory human rights education” and Boston’s), including women’s empowerment and horizontal involvement (vs. trickle-down strategy)
- [MackLeJe09]”coordinated community abandonments (Dagne 2008, http://www.kmgselfhelp.org/hotissues.html). Both human rights deliberation and coordinated community abandonment are necessary for change. National programmes in Egypt and Sudan are promoting positive human rights messages and discussions at national, regional, and local levels, and are experimenting with a variety of coordinated abandonment through community dialogue efforts at the local level. “ (use [Dagn09, MackLeJe09] for this idea)
- a bottom-up intervention aimed at changing social expectation [BiccMari15]
- Instead of focusing on improving knowledge and changing attitudes, we need to be more cautious about implementation of social norm interventions and infuse intervention in a relational dimension and a dynamic framework [CislHeis18a, CislHeis18b, McCh15].  Empowering local community and opinion leaders in implementing “organized diffusion” [MackLeJe09]has proven cost-effective [CislDenn19]. (and Boston?)

[Cami15]: “ interventions against FGC, rather than leading to the abandonment of the practice, can have unintended and potentially harmful effects on the way FGC is performed.”


-- Limitation --
While beliefs of FGC benefits was a clear factor associating with women’s intention of cutting their daughters, our findings could not clarify what benefits exactly the women believed?  As proposed that social norm and the behavior it compels cannot be inferred from personal attitude [Mack18] (in rebuttal letter), a further analysis to entangle the FGC beliefs is expected.

- No FGC types relating to our response variables

- Not controlling for daughter’s age

- Not considering heterogeneity.
