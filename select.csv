## G115: Any daughter who is not circumcised (for those from G108)
## G116: Intends to have daughter(s) circumcised in future.  This question was answered by women who has daughter not yet cut. They were from G115 (Any daughter who is not circumcise) who answered yes and from G108 (Number of  daughters circumcised) who answered 95 (No daughter circumcised).
