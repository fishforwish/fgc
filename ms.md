Background
=================
\hypertarget{Background}{%
\section{Background}\label{Background}}

Female genital multilation/cutting (FGMC), circumcision or mutilation is a form of mutilating or injuring female's genitalia for non-medical purposes [Momo17].  Following Tostan and UNFPA [Tost15, UNFP25], we use both “cutting” and multilation, to connote a human rights viewpoint while recognizing a sensitivity of identity in making decision about FGMC [JohnEsse10, KawoAllw22, Meye00, Shel01, Tost15].
 
It was estimated that at least 230 million women and girls are survivors of FGMC in 2024, mostly in Africa and the Middle East and with most girls cut before age 15 [UNIC24], although the exact prevalence might be under reported due to its deeply embedded social-cultural practice mostly deemed illegal [StevKell22].  The practice was investigated as public health issues and human rights violations in one end, and cultural and religious identity on the other [AhmeKare18, BergDeni13a, JohaAhme21, Joha22, KhosBane17, LienSchu13, Mack00, McCaBroe19, Momo17, NabMuul19, PalmElme23, RoveUlri22, TordBish22] \cfonly{to divide and confirm}.  While the United Nations has called for FGMC elimination by 2030 [Unit22], progress of intervention is impeded [TordBish22] for its complicated history [BergDeni12, Cami16].  Further, the practice was observed in cross-border and transnational environment after migrating to countries where FGMC was banned [Unit22].

Despite various degrees of legal actions against FGMC in African countries, the laws have not been easily translated to abandonment  [ChegAske04, Bicc10, Cami15, CislHeis18, McCaBroe19, NabMuul19]\cfonly{less cites}, for social norm plays a main determinant of FGMC which is deeply rooted in the tradition [Hayf05, Mack00, Momo17, SchuLien13].   Beliefs of justifying FGMC practice was as much regarded by those who identify with the tradition as those against it [DoucDela22]. Social norm is a form of values driving behavioural patterns which are self-enforcing within a group [Youn15], and it is at the core of why FGMC persisted for thousand years of the ancient history [KoubMuas85].  Comprehending the norm is crucial in changing FGMC conventions [Bicc10, Cami15, CislHeis18, KawoAllw22, Mack96, MataEeke23, Momo17, Youn15] \cfonly{update}.

Social convention theory, the leading theory probing FGMC tradition (e.g., see [BoylMcMo02, BoylCorl10, FreyJohn07, FrieMahm13, Hayf05, KandMwek09, Mack06, MackLeJe09, ReigGonz14, YirgKass12] \cfonly{update}) initially proposed that FGMC was a marriageability convention through coordination [Mack96], and later embraced with broader social norms, such as social prestige, adolescent rite of passage, and female honour and modesty [Mack96, Mack00, MackLeJe09].  The theory lays a foundation of understanding the complexity of FGMC practice within its normatively embedded community [GutiSola22, Haye05, KandShel19].  The theory regards FGMC as a social expectation of interdependent behavior among and coordinated by members in their social network (for examples, see [GreiBarn20, Haye05, KandShel19, MackLeJe09, ShelWand11, WandShel20]) \cfonly{more cites}. It was noted that the normative coordination was challenged for no clear tipping point occurred in the coordinated communities [AgolRich20 EffeVogt15].

FGMC is strongly correlated with social expectation (i.e., what other people do or what other people believe one should do)[BiccMari15,MataEeke23] \cfonly{more cites}.  Basically, when FGMC norms within the communities are strong, individuals tend to self-enforce and coordinate such norms [Ajze02, Hayf05, KandNwak09, KandShel19, Mack96, Mack06, MackLeJe09, ThomMadd92] \cfonly{add [Bicc15]]\cfonly{cut cites}.  The normative factors have underlined women’s decisions of having their daughters undergoing FGMC [AlcaGonz13, GutiSola22, Hayf05, Mack09, PashPonn16, Rima08, ShelWand11], whether the decision was a personal choice or an anticipated collective preference of their community [ForsIsak21].

The social advantages of the practice ranged from showing respect to the authority of the cut elders [ShelWand11], appreciation of the tradition, feminine virtue [WandShel20] and religious requirement [GreiBarn20], to avoiding the ongoing socially psychological discrimination from being denied their group identities [OmigBell22].  FGMC was also viewed as a form of social and symbolic capital [Bour84] to differentiate cut women from the uncuts for seeking inclusion by their social groups [OmigBell22, ShelWand11, WandShel20].

Although FGMC norms associated with FGMC behavior have been studied as aforementioned, and analyses of FGMC practices using DHS data were also found (such as [AyenWol23, AzezWill20, TordBish22, YounCheo20]), there was limited clarification of quantitative types of individual normative attitudes (e.g., attitudinal position of FGMC values) and behavioural intention in response to the community persistence. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed types of social norms women attached to FGMC beliefs categorized in DHS along with women's gender-based awareness [GrosHayf19] both individually and collectively. Integrating gender awareness when analyzing FGMC intention was relevant [BoylSvec19, HayfGarv20, Youn04, YounCheo20].   We believe this is the first FGMC study integrating quantitative DHS modules of FGMC normative attitudes and gender awareness to model the FGMC intention within the community influence.  Hopefully, the finding will add a robust understanding of advanced quantitative comparisons of FGMC norms across nations.

Some women might decide to have FGMC on their daughters even they do not believe the value themselves [ShelResh16]
Research Questions
=================
\hypertarget{Research-Questions}{%
\section{Research Questions}\label{Research-Questions}}

There are two research questions:  first, what is the association between mothers' beliefs about the benefits of FGMC and their plans for their daughters' FGMC future; second, what is the association between woman's beliefs and their opinion about whether FGMC should be continued.  
The two questions were tested as the daughter model, and the continuance model respectively.
\cfcmt{Do we test countries separately and all together in one big dataset?}

\hypertarget{methods}{%

\hypertarget{data-selection}{%
\subsection{Data selection}\label{data-selection}}

We analyzed women aged 15-49 from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) when it met the research criteria:  countries with clear FGMC Practice [KoskHeym17, UNIC16], and with FGMC benefit module.  As a result, four countries of the most recent available datasets were selected:  Kenya 2008/9, Mali 2006, Nigeria 2008 and Sierra Leone 2008 \cfcmt{checked and updated in Aug 6, 2024.}. 
The FGMC prevalence in Kenya and Nigeria were over 20\% and Mali and Sierra Leon over 85\% during that time, which represented the middle-lower vs. high prevalence of FGMC [UNIC16].  
In addition, Kenya and Nigeria were observed a declined prevalence of FGMC, while the prevalence in Mali and Sierra Leone were stably high or increasing [KoskHeym17]. CF:  to update with FGMC rate.
Although the datasets seemed outdated, it should not affect the study purpose which is to understand associations of FGMC norms and behaviors.  \cfcmt{See https://github.com/fishforwish/FGMC/blob/master/README.md for updated info}. 

Only women with daughters for FGMC options were included in the the daughter future model and the persistence model.  We did not consider whether women had daughters already cut, nor the ages of their uncut daughters.  The information was collected from the question of whether to intend "to have daughter(s) circumcised in future" answered by women who had daughter(s) not cut yet based on the DHS phase 5 survey \{https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSQMP/DHS5_Module_Female_Genital_Cutting.pdf, https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSG4/Recode5DHS_23August2012.pdf}.  The continuance model included all the women in the surveys who heard of FGMC; and that resulted in xxx, xxx, xxx and xxx, and 7861, 13071, 18311 and 7231 in Kenya, Mali, Nigeria and Sierra Leon respectively. \cfcmt{FGMC module at \url{https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSQMP/DHS5_Module_Female_Genital_Cutting.pdf}}

\hypertarget{Measurements}{%
\subsection{Measurements}\label{Measurements}}

The main responses and predictors in the models are: FGMC daughters predicted by FGMC benefits in the daughter future model, FGMC future predicted by FGMC benefits in the continuance model, and FGMC daughters predicted by both FGMC benefits and FGMC continuance in the persistence model.  Women's FGMC status was also treated as a main predictor in all the three models.  The FGMC benefits were quantified using average score \cfcmt{pls confirm] to identify the strength of FGMC beliefs associating with FGMC practice.

The co-variables were basic social demographic factors:  country, education, job, residence (rural vs. urban), religion, marital status, age, media use, and wealth in addition to gender awareness.  Gender awareness (see — for questions of gender awareness proxy) was considered a sensible factor in FGMC decision [BoylSvec19?] and therefore was included to test its association with FGMC decision overall [BoylSvec19].  Media use and gender awareness were also scored.  Cluster ID (i.e., villages where the samples were from) and ethnicity (see the list of ethnicity recode at table xx in appendix) \cfonly{with a footnote on how we recoded it] were treated as random variables.

\cfcmt{ETHNICITY:  numbers of ethnicity groups in DHS:  Kenya 13, Mali 13, Nigeria 11, SL 10 groups.  Is it possible to treat ethnicity as a explanatory variable?  "Some factors that may affect FGMC could not be tested because of data limitations. In some communities, ethnic divisions ... could be influential in the perpetuation of FGMC.... We could not capture these things in our statistical models"[BoylSvec19]).  "For maternal ethnicity, we include all ethnic groups except in Côte d'Ivoire. In that country, the DHS provides a collapsed ethnicity variable combining over 60 ethnic groups into five broad categories.. [HayfGarv20].

The following response factors were also tested at a community level to assess the collective aspect of FGMC behavior:  mothers' intention on FGMC daughters, FGMC continuance, FGMC benefits and FGMC prevalence as well as the basic social-demographic factors:  education, wealth, media use, gender awareness \cfcmt{ethnicity or not?}.  Also, cluster was treated as a proxy to represent a community level of impact [AliaRen06, HayfGarv20, KohlBehr00, Krav02].

\fcmt{How do we define community?  Is it based on cluster?} [See GrosHayf19]
\cfcmt{Should we explain how we dealt with a cluter where the sample was too small?}

\cfcmt{Regarding FGMC benefits modules, there were 9 questions.  Kenya had all the 9, Mali and SL 7 missing promiscuity and STD, NG 8 missing STD).  Is it a problem?]

\cfcmt{Bayesian model [KandNwak09] “Conversely, one cannot assume that the clusters selected in each district are fully representative of the states in which they are located because surveys only attempted to generate a fully representative sample at the regional level. Consequently, the spatial analysis will be affected by some random fluctuations.  Some of this random variation can be reduced through structured spatial effects because it includes neighboring observations in the analysis. However, it should be pointed out that such a spatial analysis should preferably be applied to census data, where the precision of the spatial analysis would be much higher." (p. 788)]


\hypertarget{Statistical-Model}{%
\subsection{Statistical Model}\label{Statistical-Model}}

We used cumulative link mixed models (CLMMs) in the statistics package R [Rstats,Rpackage_ordinal] to analyze the models.  The CLMM framework allows us to model a binary or ordinal response variable (i.e., intention of applying FGMC to daughters and whether to continue FGMC practice; unless continuance was treated as an ordinal), while treating clusters and ethnicity as random effects.  
We subtracted respondent (-1) from the cluster when testing the community effect \cfcmt{Please rewrite this. Also, do we need to mention how we treat some clusters which had only one sample (if that happens).}

\section{Results}\label{results}}

Baseline sociodemographic and sample characteristics are shown in figure x.  The prevalence of FGMC were 31.8\%, 45.9\%, 88.6\% and 91.0\%, intention to have their daughters cut 12.3\%, 7.9\%, 47\% and 80.4\%, and supporting FGMC practice in the future 15.5\%, 20.6\%, 73.9\% and 65.5\% in Kenya, Nigeria, Mali and Sierra Leon accordingly.  The results showed patterns that the higher FGMC prevalence is, the more likely respondents will have their daughters undergoing FGMC and more likely to support FGMC practice in the future.  

\cfcmt{M: sample size of daughters plan in sociodemographic figure?  It should be only the women with daughters for FGMC.]

The results of the three models are at figure xxx \cf{isoplots and effect plots].  The findings showed robust results.  The main predictors, women’s FGMC status, beliefs of FGMC benefits and FGMC prevalence were all clearly and positively associated with the two responses (intention to cut daughters and attitudes on whether FGMC should be continued) in all the three models; so as the following factors but in negative associations:  age, education, media, religion and the community levels of beliefs of FGMC benefits \cf{this one is tricky to interpret].  In addition, group level of intention to cut daughters was also clearly and positively associated with respondents’ intention to cut their daughter, as well as group persistence of FGMC practice with the women’s attitudes on FGMC practice.   Although gender awareness was positively associated with both responses but only at an individual level not a group level.

Basically, After adjusting for individual- and community-level factors, our main models indicated that respondents’ intention of having their daughters cut was mostly associated with the group intention on this matter (see Fig x daughterPlan-effects-plot.Rout.pdf and iso plots) \cf{group-daughterPlan  142.11  1  < 2.2e-16.  How to transfer this into a more understandable sentence?]:  the stronger the intention of cutting daughters within their group, the more likely a respondent’s intention to cut their daughters.  Similarly in the persistent model (see persistence effect plots and iso plots), the higher the attitudes on carrying on FGMC practice within a group, the more likely a respondent’s attitude on supporting such a practice.  Both models also showed that women’s beliefs in FGMC benefits and their FGMC status positively related to their likelihood of cutting their daughters, and supporting the practice.

The results also showed that age had a negative nonlinear correlation with women’s intention of cutting their daughters (see daughter isoplot.  i.e., the younger a woman was, the more likely to cut daughters) and with their attitudes on FGMC continuity (i.e., the younger they were,  the more likely to support FGMC practice).  Wealth did not show correlation with cutting daughters but did in predicting FGMC continuity (see persistence isoplot):  the higher the wealth level was, the less likely to support FGMC, but the higher the group wealth level, the more likely to support the practice.  (For other variables, see all the three iso plots and effect plots.)

In Kenya, "A daughter’s adjusted hazard of FGMC was lower if she: had an uncut mother who disfavored FGMC, lived in a community that was more opposed to FGMC, and lived in a more ethnically diverse community. Unexpectedly, a daughter’s adjusted FGMC hazard was higher if she lived in a community with more extra-familial opportunities for women. " [GrosHayf19]

\cf{Need some discuss of the mixed model:  how it help to clarify our main models or what?]

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

--Main interpretation --

Based on the findings which rebutted a previous study [EffeVogt15], we believed that FGMC is a social coordinated norm [MakieETC] in the studied countries (Kenya, Mali, Nigeria and Sierra Leon):  an individual behavioral intention is subjected to the normative ritual in their community.  The norm of FGMC is synergistic, based on what women think about other women’s likely position in their community (i.e., likelihood of others to cut their daughters) and values they attached to this practice (i.e., beliefs of FGMC benefits).  We propose that a mother’s intention of cutting their daughters was overdetermined by her community’s overall intention to cut daughters and her personal beliefs of FGMC benefits more than her own FGMC status and FGMC prevalence in the community (see daughrer isoplot x and effect plots x)\cf{Can we use some stat to elaborate our argument?].  The similar coordination also applied to supporting FGMC practice in the future.  The coordinated performance could (or would be?) be a result of subjective norm as perceived social pressure to perform such behaviour or expected choice of conduct [Ajze91]. \cfonly{FGMC is less a coordination rite than singling group identity and symbolism [ShelWand11, Youn15]] \cf{But what is this coordination based on if not marriageability?  What can we find from the benefits PCAs?].  \cfonly{Need to add Hayf05]

Social demographically, compared to a systematic review [AyenWol24], which found that the primary factors promoting the practice of FGMC were family history of circumcision, being a Muslim religion follower, poor wealth index, higher age, and rural residency, our findings showed that.....

That mothers’ beliefs in FGMC benefits was a strong predictor of mothers' intentions to have their daughters to undergo FGMC was well studied [PashPonn16] (more), yet our findings suggested that community’s overall intention on forgoing the practice was equally strong if not more forceful.  When influences from within the communities are strong, individuals tend to self-enforce norms of what the community expect from their behaviours [Hayf05, KandNwak09, Mack96, Mack06, MackLeJe09] (more, Bicc11).  It could be a social norm implicitly supported by social sanction (i.e., cutting daughter) [Bicchieri06, MackLeJe09] (confirm).  The correlation between women’s beliefs of FGMC benefits and group intention of cutting daughters needs further studied to apprehend intentional behaviour and beliefs of normative practice of FGMC for the intervention. \cf{Should the last sentence be in recommendation section?].

Based on our analysis of the benefit index \cf{the 4 countries’ PCA results], marriageability was only one benefit for FGMC, there were multiple factors in influencing women’s decision of cutting their daughters [MackLeJe09] when religious leaders believed that FGMC is useful for reducing the sexual desire of women to prevent adultery and and to enhance hygiene of women [AhmeKare18].  It is likely that marriageability is no longer a strong belief in community where FGMC is still common and new norms are insinuated around [EffeVogt15, ShelWand11, RoveUlri22] (more).  Reasons for FGMC practice could go beyond the belief of marriage prospects and extend to peer convention [ShelWand11].  In Ethiopia, the majority of women who were aware of the negative reproductive health effects had not stopped the practice highlighted the possible fear of isolation and being alienated from the cultural system where FGMC could be seen as a force of social cohesion [YirgKass12].  In Kenya, woman's decision on whether to implement FGMC on their daughters were likely to relate to collective identity within ethnic groups against broader social changes [Achi14, Hayf05]; similarly findings observed in Nigeria [FreyJohn07, KandMwek09].

Regarding community beliefs of FGMC benefits, it had a negative correlation with both women’s intention of cutting their daughters and FGMC continuance:  the stronger the overall FGMC benefits was, the less likely a mother to cut their daughters and less likely to support the practice.  This was against common wisdom [].  One possible explanation is that “it's left over after we include community behaviour. If the community believes in it, they'll probably do it, and then I'll probably do it. But if I \emph{control for] community behaviour, there's no reason to think that community belief is still explanatory. In fact, if I see myself as different from the community I'm more likely to break the norm than if I don’t.” \cfcmt{J:  This is basically your words.  Can you rewrite it?  And I don’t understand the last sentence.]  It was noted that sum of benefits does not equal norm [RimaLapi15]  \cfonly{Need to add Hayf05]

Basically, the norm spectrum spanned from eliminating FGMC due to the violation of human rights to continuing the FGMC practice for ethnic identities [Hayf05, GrosHayf19, Youn02], and ambivalent contemplations of the practice in between [EarpJohn20, GrueEarp20, Joha19, JohaAhme21, Leon20]. For example, if a symbolic "nick" [KoskHeym17] would reach a shared ground.

It is noted that the countries analyzed did not legally ban FGMC practice until 2011 in Keyna [UNIC20] and 2015 in Nigeria [UNIC21a], and no plan of banning the practice in Sierra Leon despite an enacted Child Rights Act [AmeyTett20, Dyer24], nor in Mali [CetoWils20].  In the legal context, the findings showed that.,,,,

— socio demographic factors —

Our models showed that the four countries were clearly different in intention of cutting their daughters with Sierra Lion of the highest likelihood and Nigeria compared to FGMC prevalence where Sierra Leon had the highest prevalence, followed by Mali, Nigeria and Kenya; yet their attitudes of supporting FGMC practice was not clear despite the factor of FGMC prevalence \cf{figure xx and figure xxx].  Regarding sociodemographic factors, education (community), wealth (individual and community) and job (individual) did not predict women’s intention on cutting their daughters, nor did gender awareness (community).  "Autonomous decision-making by women at the community level was associated with lower odds of daughters being cut."[BoylSvec19]

The positive impact modernization [BoylMcMo02, Youn02] and gender/feminist perspectives [BoylSvec19, DalaLawo10, Dell04, FrieMahm13, KandNwak09, Lewi04, Meye00, Njam04, YirgKass12, Youn02] on intention of cutting daughters were not obvious than the convention approach in our findings as well as previously concluded [Hayf05] \cfonly{to confirm]. While a daughter’s FGMC risk was higher if she was in a community with a higher community-level of women’s extra familial opportunities (e.g., education, paid work and marital background) [GrosHayf19], our findings showed that community level of education was not a clear determinant of daughter’s FGMC risk, compare to a previous study showed that community education had no clear effect on the likelihood of daughter’s FGMC future, while the individual education did in Kenya [Hayf05].

Regarding FGMC continuity, education and wealth (both individual and community level) were clearly correlated with attitudes towards FGMC continuation in our findings.  While both wealth level and education of community level had a positive association with FGMC discontinuation (i.e., the higher the education and wealth level were, the less likely to support FGMC practice in the future), individual education had an opposite correlation; the results was compared to what was observe in Sierra Lion where both individual level of educate and wealth were positively associated with support of FGMC abandonment [Sagn14], and to Egpyt [DalaLawo10, VanMeek16]. A secondary analysis of the Egypt DHS from 1995 to 2014 showed a positive correlation of individual level of education, job and wealth with their attitudes of FGMC continuity [VanMeek15] .  It is also important to engage community and religious leaders to understand the need for change and to generate a transformation within the culture [KleiHelz18].  It is also important to think about how FGMC is different from male circumcision and whether a safe medical service is possible [GrueEarp20, Joha22, KimaShell18, RoveUlri22].

It is noticed that the patterns of FGMC benefits based on the PCA results \cfcmt{M: PCA figures] indicated that benefits of FGMC was not as clearly elaborated as the benefit module categorized.  The main index was grouped as others.  It means that the main reasons of why mothers intended to cut their daughters or what they believe was the real benefits/reason was not clearly stated. It could be reasons aforementioned as, for example, peer convention [GrosHayd19CONFIRM, ShelWand11].  Further field research is recommended to further clarify reasons of cutting.

Although FGMC prevalence was a main factor predicting daughter’s FGMC status [BoylSvec19] \cf{more cites], we found that overall community intention explained more variance than FGMC prevalence on respondents’ intention of cutting daughters cfonly{ show daughter effect plot]:  What their community members will do is likely to determine what a mother intends to do with their daughters’ FGMC status. In this case, what people did (descriptive norm?) was less a force than what they will do.  In other words, - descriptive norm (i.e., FGMC prevalence) was undermined by subjective norm (community intentional behaviour of . \cf{One confusing finding is that all the three models showed group FGMC benefits are robustly and negatively associated with the responses.].  Norms sustained through communications and evolve through social interactions [FishAjze10, RimaLapi15].   There are conventional roots in FGMC practice [FreyJohn07, Hayf05, KandShel19, Mack96, ShelWand11] which may evolve into various forms of conventional norms, such as peer convention [GrosHayd19CONFIRM, ShelWand11] (more)

"modernisation-related factors were stronger predictors of abandonment attitudes than of FGMC status" [GreiBarn20] (more), our findings support (or not)?
A systematic review showed that "A lower level of maternal education, family history of FGM/C, or belonging to the Muslim religion (in certain contexts) increased the likelihood of FGM/C. The majority of studies that examined higher paternal education (for girls only) and living in an urban region showed a reduced likelihood of FGM/C, while conflicting evidence remained for wealth. Several studies reported that FGM/C literacy, and low community FGM/C prevalence were associated with a reduced likelihood of FGM/C." [ElFaro22]

"wealth index, education level, history of circumcision, and regional variation are associated with women's attitude towards discontinuation of the practice of FGM in Ethiopia. " [AhmeSeid22]

Norms can be rooted in what one thinks, passively or actively, others think which can be based on one's action or the communication. Change should be coordinated among interrelated members of social networks [Mack96, Mack00, MackLeJe09, ShelWand11]

Data showed that Kenya, Nigeria and Sierra Leon had shown strong progress in eliminating FGMC over the last 30 years, which Mali’s progress stagered [UNIC25].

Regarding ethnicity, "Egypt is relatively homogenous country, both in terms of religion and in terms of ethnicity, while the four countries in our sample are ethnically diverse, and Burkina Faso and Côte d'Ivoire are religiously diverse as well. It is possible that the association of maternal FGMC attitudes with daughters’ outcome varies across communities in complex ways that are not well-captured by the interactions we tested. Further exploration is needed to understand this variation in these more diverse contexts." [HayfGarv20]

---- Mali: ``The occurrence of FGM/C is also concentrated in certain West African countries where prevalence rates range from 72–96 percent: Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Guinea, and Mali. The populations of these countries share certain social and historical ties, which suggests that a strategy to eliminate FGM/C in one of these countries might be successful in others. FGM/C is practiced as part of the initiation into a secret society in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We should expect that the repercussions for mothers there who do not send their daughters to be initiated would be different than for mothers in nearby Mali or Guinea [YodaWang13]

— Suggestions —

- How to adverse the health consequence:  Can FGMC be abolished/contained?
- vs. MC
- Qualitative research to gather more elaborated answers of benefits of FGMC
- More options of FGMC benefit module is suggested.
- family dynamics are relevant to gain support to end female genital cutting”[Hayf06]
- " the grounds for a growing critical consensus that current anti-FGM laws and policies may be ethically incoherent, empirically unsupportable, and legally unsustainable."[EarpJohn20]
- Involve elders and traditional leaders to address the issue of those who wish not to participate in the cutting practice [ChegAske04, more]

Changes of social norms in public health behaviours may require a few steps:  motivation, deliberation and action [CislHeis18a].  An alternative to FGMC (e.g., a complete stop or a symbolic pricking) will have to provide motivation and facilitate the change of behaviour; the behavioural change will have to be a social action (i.e., gaining recognition and public participation within community) since FGMC is a social norm;  and a public commitment to change in hope for reaching a critical mass needed to dismantle the normative behaviour. (using Tostan as an example) (also see [Youn15].  Promising change are observed in changing norms [EvanSnid19] (and Tostan).  How to foresee a community conducive to certainty for girls without FGMC?

- Based on the results, group benefit did not show clear influences on women's position on cutting daughters nor on support of FGMC practice.  One possible reason might be the validity of the module of the FGMC beneifts which could be overdated.  The newest version of Keyna DHS replaced the benefits questionnaire with questions of cultural and social accpetance.  It will be helpful to study the newer dataset on FGMC norms and behavior.

Unlike foot binding which was displayed in public, the outcome of FGMC can only be identified through private channels (e.g., a tight group community or personnel communications).  The intervention of FGMC via public rejection or condemnation is more questionable (or challenging, especially when if marriage is no longer a main reason for FGMC).  While the comparison of foot binding had a public norm effect, the difference between FGMC and no FGMC is more personal.  A bottom-up campaign empowering local community and engaging women in change of the practice is essential [BergDeni13b] and messages tailoring differences of normative beliefs in different groups should also be considered.  The practice of FGMC is likely to be revised due to types of FGMC, but how to eradicate it if it evolves to just a “nick” [KoskHeym17] compared to the norm of male circumcision as a state of identity [Earp15, HanbEsse21, PalmElme23]?

- MC vs. FGMC.  If MC is an ethnic identity among Jewish community and is overall accepted around the world, can FGMC be granted for a similar value if it is just a "nick?"
Considering the acceptance of Alternative rights of passage [GaluKama15] without criminalize the practice. (I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this position, but it is an alternative.) vs. focused on empowerment, and campaigns to recruit change agents from within communities (to eradicate FGMC) [ShelHern13, Will18]; medicalizing FGMC [LeyeVanE19]
- modelling by plotting empirical data to study threshold/tipping point.
- redesign questions of FGMC benefits in DHS
- inviting faced women migrated to western society to participate in FGMC intervention campaign.  For example,  attitude change: "migrating to and living in Sweden facilitates a transition in attitudes regarding FGMC" [WahlJohn17], and initiating “participatory campaign and education”  (an idea from [MackLeJe09]’s “participatory human rights education” and Boston’s), including women’s empowerment and horizontal involvement (vs. trickle-down strategy)
- [MackLeJe09]”coordinated community abandonments (Dagne 2008, http://www.kmgselfhelp.org/hotissues.html). Both human rights deliberation and coordinated community abandonment are necessary for change. National programmes in Egypt and Sudan are promoting positive human rights messages and discussions at national, regional, and local levels, and are experimenting with a variety of coordinated abandonment through community dialogue efforts at the local level. “ (use [Dagn09, MackLeJe09] for this idea)
- a bottom-up intervention aimed at changing social expectation [BiccMari15]
- Instead of focusing on improving knowledge and changing attitudes, we need to be more cautious about implementation of social norm interventions and infuse intervention in a relational dimension and a dynamic framework [CislHeis18a, CislHeis18b, McCh15].  Empowering local community and opinion leaders in implementing “organized diffusion” [MackLeJe09]has proven cost-effective [CislDenn19]. (and Boston?)

[Cami15]: “ interventions against FGMC, rather than leading to the abandonment of the practice, can have unintended and potentially harmful effects on the way FGMC is performed.”

[NabMuul19]: legal and ethnical background in African countries

- Any questions can be added to the DHS FGMC module to gather more relavent and udpated reasaons why continue FGMC?

-- Limitation --
While beliefs of FGMC benefits was a clear factor associating with women’s intention of cutting their daughters, our findings could not clarify what benefits exactly the women believed?  As proposed that social norm and the behavior it compels cannot be inferred from personal attitude [Mack18] (in rebuttal letter), a further analysis to entangle the FGMC beliefs is expected.

- No FGMC types relating to our response variables

- Not controlling for daughter’s age

- Not considering heterogeneity.
