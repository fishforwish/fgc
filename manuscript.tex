\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

It was estimated that more than 200 million women, of which 44 millions were girls under age 15, \jd{This ratio seems super-low. I would
expect a majority under 15, no?}\cf{Most of the surveys sampled women of 15-49, girls under 15 were reported by their mothers. The ration of girls under 15 is minority} have undergone female genital cutting (FGC), mostly observed in Africa and the Middle East \cite{UNFPA14, UNIC16} (updated Sep 18).  United Nation has declared zero tolerance for FGC as it violates human rights and promoted the abundance of the practice  \cite{}.  The current progress of ending FGC is insufficient to keep up with the population growth, and girls and women undergoing FGC will rise significantly over the next 15 years if the trends continue \cite{UNIC16} (also see
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ updated Sep, 18) \jd{This claim is surprising, and the sources are not
academic.}\cf{UN is supposed to be reliable and often quoted by academic papers}. Breaking with the tradition can be salvaging even after migration \cite{CreiSamu19, PariSaru18, WahlJohn17a}.  FGC is also known as female genital mutilation and female circumcision;
we use cutting instead because it implies a degree of self-awareness and is considered less judgmental \cite{KhahBark09, JohnEsse10,
Meye00, PariSaru18, Shel01} (and is adapted by Tostan (http://www.tostan.org/)). 

The commonly shared position for FGC is more about eradication than intervention \cite{Toub94, Mack96, UNIC16} (more cites); but the
progress is hindered due to the complicated history of the very practice \cite{cite}. The meanings of FGC are competitively defined by various groups from local religious community to international governmental institutes, by linking the practice to cultural and religious identity in one end and to public health and human rights on the other \cite{Boyl02, KhosBane17, KimaShell18, SchuLien13, WHO12}.

Social norm is \cite{DuncWand11, EffeVogt15, Hayf05, Mack96, Mack00, Youn02} a fundamental approach in understanding FGC practice while human rights and feminist theory entails \cite{Dell04, FrieMahm13,KhosBane17, Lewi95, Lewi09, Meye00, Morr08, Njam04, UNIC16, YirgKass12, Youn02} entails reasons of intervening and abolishing	the practices.  Convention theory posits FGC an important norm to control marriage fidelity and social prestige; this perspective views FGC as a social behaviour resulting from group practice, and it takes a ``critical mass" to initiate a change \cite{Mack00, MackLeJe09}.  FGC was also viewed as a social capital for inclusion and exclusion within women’s social groups \cite{Shel-Wand11}.  When norms within the communities are strong, individuals tend to self-enforce community norms \cite{Ajze02, Hayf05, KandNwak09, Mack96, Mack06, MackLeJe09, ThomMadd92}; hence, intervention of FGC targeting women's social networks, which are intergenerational, interdependent and interconnected across generations and genders was proposed \cite{Mack00, DuncWand11, ShelWand11}.

There is a wide range of gender theories on FGC (see\cite{Anti13, Hodg11, Lewi95}) and woman's empowerment on making FGC decision are shared concerns: for example, from social position \cite{VanMeek15}, autonomy \cite{Meye00}, gender equality and human rights \cite{Drol11}, to gender identity \cite{Youn04, Koom14, WintKoom09}. Both convention theory and gender approaches centre on values of how FGC associates with identity \cte{cites}.  Although convention theory was well studied and showed a larger effect on FGC practices than the others (e.g, \cite{BoylMcMo02, BoylCorl10, FreyJohn07, FrieMahm13, Hayf05, KandMwek09, Mack96, Mack06, ReigGonz14, YirgKass12}), gender perspective can shed lights on how women’s gender values intertwine with convention theory of FGC values \cite{cites}.   Multiple theoretical frameworks would have to be incorporated to grasp a full explanation of the persistence and decline of FGC due to the heterogeneity of the population \cite{Hayf05, EffeVogt15, ModrLiu13}.  


\subsection{Research Questions}\label{research-questions}

Identifying benefits of FGC practice is crucial to promote sustainable change \cite{EffeVogt15}.  This study takes both the dynamics of beliefs of FGC benefits and of intention of FGC practices into account at both a population and a community level to understand associations of FGC values and intention of carrying out the practices l \cite{BoylCorl010, Drol11,Hayf05, Grue05, Hodg11,KandNwak09, OdukAfol17} (to confirm).  We developed three models in this study.  The main one is the “daughter” model, which analyzed associations of beliefs of FGC benefits (see the list of FGC benefits at table xx) and intention to cut daughters in the hope that if patterns of social norms (i.e., aggregation of values of FGC benefits) associating behavioral intention can be detected.  Additionally, we also decompose the model into two “structural” models:  “future” model to study women’s beliefs of FGC benefits and FGC continuance; and “future_daughter” model to examine the association of beliefs of FGC benefits, FGC continuance and intention of cutting daughters to understand how such positions change the main model.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsubsection{Data and Samples}\label{data-and-samples}

We analyzed the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) by USAID.  Countries with the following criteria were selected:  high FGC prevalence \cite{UNIC16}, DHS surveys with modules of FGC benefits, and index of gender awareness; and that resulted in four nations:  Kenya 2008/9, Mali 2006, Nigeria 2008 and Sierra Leone 2008.  We did not analyze the newest dataset due to the lack of FGC benefits modules before this study finished for publication (checked in 1/09/19).

Only women with daughters to be considered for FGC were included in the main model (the daughter model) and the future-daughter model, while the future model included all the women in the samples; that resulted in xxx, xxx and xxx (or three more if sample sizes in individual models are different from the full models) respectively.

\subsubsection{Measurements and Concepts}\label{measurements-and-concepts}
\cf{\cite{Rima08}}*

The main response variables were woman's intention to cut their daughters in the daughter model and the daughter-future model, and woman's attitude on whether FGC should be continued in the FGC future model.  The main predictors were woman's FGC status, beliefs of FGC benefits and attitudes of gender equality.  Other socio demographic variables were also included:  age, education, religion (see the list of religion recode at table xx in appendix; with a footnote on how we recoded it), marital status, work status, media and residence (urban vs. rural) in addition to country.  The followings were treated as random variables:  cluster ID (villages) and ethnicity (see the list of ethnicity recode at table xx in appendix; with a footnote on how we recoded it).

In order to address the significance of community impact on the practice of FGC, education, wealth, media use, FGC beliefs, gender awareness and FGC prevalence were also tested at the community level \cf{on a cluster level, not national, right?} in response to the degrees of modernization, conventional values and gender awareness within- and among-community (see \cite{Achi14, BoylMcMo02, Hayf05, KandNwak09, ModrLiu13, Moor13, OdukAfol17, Youn02}).}).  Cluster  was used to represent a community level of impact \cite{AligRen06, Hayf05}

\jdcmt{Ideally, we would make ethnicity a random effect, but we are back to the Gilmour problem I guess.} \cfcmt{Ethnicity is an important factor (see Hayf05), more so than religion, associating with FGC status, and I don't think it shall be coded as a random factor.  But as J said, it is too hard! } %``explicitly including ethnicity is a means of assessing another dimension of the collective aspect of circumcision behavior. `` \cite{Hayf05}
\cf{Bayesian model \cite{KandNwak09} ``Conversely, one cannot assume that the clusters selected in each district are fully representative of the states in which they are located because surveys only attempted to generate a fully representative sample at the regional level. Consequently, the spatial analysis will be affected by some random fluctuations.  Some of this random variation can be reduced through structured spatial effects because it includes neighboring observations in the analysis. However, it should be pointed out that such a spatial analysis should preferably be applied to census data, where the precision of the spatial analysis would be much higher." (p. 788)}
\cfcmt{Regarding FGC benefits modules, there were 9 questions.  Keya had all the 9, Mali and SL 7 (missing promiscuity and STD), NG 8, missing STD).  Should we drop STD since 3 out of 4 missed this variable?}

\subsubsection{Statistical Model}\label{statistical-model}

We used cumulative link mixed models (CLMMs) in the statistics package R \cite{Rstats,Rpackage_ordinal} to analyze the models.  The CLMM framework allows us to model a binary or ordinal response variable (i.e., intention of cutting daughters and whether to continue FGC practice), while treating clusters and ethnicity as random effects.

\cfcmt{Our response ARE categorical not binary; AND still need to explain why ethnicity is a random effect. AND media use was supposed to be incorporated as a random factor at the country level, based on the assumption that media content likely varied among countries.}

\subsection{Results}\label{results-1}

Baseline socio-demographic and sample characteristics are shown in xxx.  The prevalence of FGC are \%, \%, \% and \% in Kenya, Mali, Nigeria and Sierra Leon accordingly, and \%, \%, \% and \%  of the samples thought FGC should continue as well.  

The results of the three models are at ____.  The findings showed that all the three responses were clearly associated with the following predictors:  women’s fgc status, beliefs of fgc benefits and FGC prevalence in a community; so as the following factors:  country, media, education, age and religion and the community levels of media, education.  We did not find clear association of the community level of beliefs of fgc benefits and the three responses.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{Discussion}

--Main interpretation --

Our findings showed that women’s decision on cutting their daughters was clearly associated with their own FGC status and beliefs in FGC benefits at a population (?) level and FGC prevalent at a community level; the results also applied to their views of FGC continuity .  However, the women’s beliefs of FGC benefits in cutting women at a community level did not play as a clear factor in all the three FGC preferences.  Our findings implies that the practice of FGC is a social norm in terms of how a community as a whole carried out the practice.

Regarding the daughter model, 

--- conventional \cite{FreyJohn07, Hayf05, Mack96, ShelWand11} vs. modernization (cite{BoylMcMo02, Youn02}, education and wealth as index of modernization), vs. gender \cite{Dell04, FrieMahm13, Lewi04, Meye00, Njam04, YirgKass12, Youn02} (more and confirm).  
% women's empowerment appeared to be more important in explaining differences across communities\cite{ModrLiu13} (more).
% ``attitude is the strongest predictor of mothers' intentions to allow their daughters to undergo FGM, followed by subjective norms." \cite{PashPonn16}
\cf{Mackie's social convention theory was supported in \cite{Shel-Wand11}; futher, \cite{ShelWand11} proposed that reasons for fgc practice go beyond the belief that it is advantageous for marriage prospects. FGC allows women to gain social capitals and access to networks.  Their findings also suggested that the main deterent to marriages was not men's refusal of non-fgc women, but hostility and discrimination from fgc women to non fgc women}.

--- community levels of impact and intervention

\cite{EffeVogt15}:  Efferson proposed that cutting is not a social norm based on ``coordination,” for marital market.  The problem is that he and his colleages conclusion was based on a marraige market associating with cutting.  But it is likely that fgc is much less an action for marraige proposal but a social indentity to the group they indentify with.

The populations of these countries share certain social and historical ties, which suggests that a strategy to eliminate FGM/C in one of these countries might be successful in others. FGM/C is practiced as part of the initiation into a secret society in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We should expect that the repercussions for mothers there who do not send their daughters to be initiated would be different than for mothers in nearby Mali or Guinea \cite{YodaWang13}

---- Nigeria: ``Modernization (education and high socioeconomic status) had minimal impact on the likelihood of FGM, but education plays an important role in the mother's decision not to circumcise her daughter. It follows from these findings that community factors have a large effect on FGM, with individual factors having little effect on the distribution of FGM" \cite{KandNwak09}

==========

% collective action problem referring to community level of impact
Attitude was the strongest predictor of mothers' intentions for their daughters' FGC status, followed by subjective norms \cite{PashPonn16}. It implied that community norm (social norm) was not as clear as suggested \cite{EffeVogt15}, but believed otherwise \cite{DuncWand11, Hayf06, Mack96, Mack00, Mack06, Youn02} (to confirm).


\comment{cf: how to cite \cite{AkhmWord13,EffeVogt15} and compare these two?}
% There are "discrepancies between attitudes and practices, especially significant under an analysis by sex as, despite manifesting less support, the percentage of female HCPs declaring to have performed medicalization is almost twice the males' average. These findings suggest that female HCPs could be facing higher demand to medicalize the practice, and that, even when brought to the medical setting, FGM/C is regarded as a women's issue to be performed by women to women." \cite{KaplSing16}

% "autonomy within culture" is socially situated and entails neither endorsement of FGC nor resignation to its persistence." \cite{Meye00}:  How can we apply this feminism perspective to our findings? (Since we did not categorize types of fgc in our study, we can't know if women of autonomy prefer to have a "nick" on their daughter to preserve cultural identity or abandon fgc completely.

% \cite{WahlJohn17} showed that change does occur in newly immigrants once they were relocated to a new society where FGC was defied; how does this compared to \cite{EffeVogt15}'s heterogeneous model?


% little support for seeing FGC a prerequisite for marriage or related to marrying well, but peer pressure was an important factor on FGC decision (i.e., peer convention instead of marriage convention.) \cite{DuncWand11}
% put religion into consideration of our findings (i.e., national distribution of religion, how many muslins in each country)
% when influences from within the communities are strong, individuals tend to self-enforce norms of what the community expect from their behaviours \cite{Hayf05, KandNwak09, Mack96, Mack06, MackLeJe09}. (from the introduction.  try to compare our result with theirs).
% mother-daughter: \cite{PashPonn16}
% \cf{the structure:  cultural and legal background; comparison of our findings to previous studies; implications}
% Wealth:  Some research showed that household wealth has nonlinear correlation with women's FGC status predictor of daughter's FGC status \cit{Hayf05}




% If convention theory is more than just about securing marriage market (e.g., peer convention), then it is a theory about norms in general, isn't it?  That is, types of norms explain better than just marriage market.


% Overall:


%Because of the social aspects associated with FGC, including gender norms and power relations, it is fundamentally important that intervention of FGC practice adopts a holistic approach to focus both on individual and the wider social dynamics \cite{BrowBeec13}. 
 \cite{Shel-Wand11}:  supporting Mackie's convetion theory ``expections regarding fgc are interdependent...."


% contagious diffusion \cite{Mack96}

% ``FGC facilitates the accumulation of social capital by younger women and of power and prestige by elder women. Based on this new evidence and reinterpretation of social convention theory, we suggest that interventions aimed at eliminating FGC should target women's social networks, which are intergenerational, and include both men and women. Our findings support Mackie's assertion that expectations regarding FGC are interdependent; change must therefore be coordinated among interconnected members of social networks." \cite{ShelWand11}

FGC is still in practice or a preference among women after migrated to a western environment from their original communities where FGC was a common practice, in the hope (wording?) of preserving their ethnic and gender identity despite its conflict against the  norms and laws of the newly settled society \cite{}; however, a baseline study in Sweden showed that a majority of female immigrants, including those newly arrived, opposed all forms of FGC with increased opposition over time after migration, and suggested that an attitude change had occurred \cite{WahlJohn17}; that suggested a likely influence of convention theory.


(There are also studies proposing various factors impacting FGC practices, such as women's education \cite{KandNwak09,VanMeek15}, social economic status \cite{} etc, community levels of influences.) (What is conventional in convention theory can also be focal points to gender awareness and modern development.  Question:  What is the differences between convention theory and community level of impact on FGC? the same or?)

These hypotheses were confirmed" (p. 23) "Older women were less likely to favor the continuation of circumcision, although each year of age increased the probability that a woman had or planned to circumcise her daughters by 6 percent. Older women may have cut their daughters before there was international pressure opposing the practice. The reverse effect for attitudes is consistent with prior findings (see Williams and Sobieszczyk, 1997). It may be an artifact of the survey technique. Older women who oppose FGC may feel freer to say so than younger women because older women are accorded considerable independence in Muslim societies (see, for example, Geiger, 1997).20" (p.24)

% "This study suggests that the adoption of a `modern' lifestyle is not an inevitable result of acquiring the tools that give a person mastery over nature.

Gender/feminist perspective:  \cite{Meye00} Meyers questions the idea of social norm and autonomy "It seems to me that we would need far more consensus than we presently have (or are likely to get) about human nature and social justice before we could conclude that women who opt for compliance with female genital cutting norms never do so autonomously.  We would have to be persuaded, in other words, that all women's interests are such that this decision could not accord with any woman's authentic values and desires under any circumstances."

%``Since autonomy-augmenting educational programs are typically developed by cultural initiates who rely on traditional modes of expression and appeal to traditional values, it is reasonable to surmise that autonomy is best extended by avoiding cultural alienation and by building on women's existing autonomy skills." 
% ``autonomy-augmenting programs regard women in cultures that practice female genital cutting as self-determining individuals. …they have some understanding of what matters to them and how best to proceed in light of their values and commitments before they participate in such programs. … women who are subject to female genital cutting are not without autonomy. But this understanding of autonomy entails neither endorsement of female genital cutting nor resignation to its persistence. Since cultures that practice female genital cutting may have selectively nurtured and stifled women's autonomy skills, and since these cultures may shield the issue of female genital cutting from exercise of autonomy skills, developing and coordinating women's autonomy skills and extending the range of application of these skills are key to augmenting their autonomy. ``
% convention or modernization theory?`` campaigns against FGC using educational, health, legal, and human rights–based approaches are at times ineffective and counterproductive when they frame the practice as a ``tradition" rooted in a ``primitive" and unchanging culture. We suggest that development interventions that do not address local contexts of FGC, including the complex politics and history of interventions designed to eradicate it, can in fact reify and reinscribe the practice as central to Maasai cultural identity." \cite{WintKoom09}

% \cite{Koom14}: `` practices of female excision are so diverse that they may defy generalizable remedies"  ``Rather than relying on common campaign models, transferable advocacy tools, or `best practices,' scholars and anti-FGM activists must rethink female excision in terms of its diverse contextual meanings and its dynamic global politics."

% "Tradition, cleanliness, and virginity were the most common motives empowering the continuation of FGM/C , followed by men's wish, esthetic factors, marriage, and religion factors.... A variety of socio-cultural myths, religious misbelievers, and hygienic and esthetic concerns were behind the FGM/C. Overall, a large proportion of the participants supported the continuation of FGM/C in spite of adverse effect and sexual dysfunction associated with FGM/C." \cite{MohaHass14}

A multicultural egalitarian approach respecting both cultural identity and basic legal human rights was addressed \cite{BoylCarb10, Wade11}.  Instead of straightforward campaigns against traditional culture, "culturalconstestaion" characterized by politicized negotiation and, at times, resistance, was proposed. \cite{Koom14}.

A synthesis of context studies of Africa showed that the main factors that supported FGC were tradition, religion, and reduction of women's sexual desire, and the main factors hindered FGM/C were medical complications and prevention of sexual satisfaction. \cite{BergDeni12a}.  For example, in Ethiopia, the majority of women who were aware of the negative reproductive health effects had not stopped the practice highlighted the possible fear of isolation and being alienated from the cultural system where FGC could be seen as a force of social cohesion \cite{YirgKass12}.  In Kenya, woman's decision on whether to cut their daughters' genitals were likely to relate to collective identity within ethnic groups against broader social changes \cite{Achi14, Hayf05}; similarly findings observed in Nigeria \cite{FreyJohn07, KandMwek09}.

"support HCPs in the integration of FGM/C preventive interventions within the public health system, to address arguments favoring medicalization, and to use data to design appropriate strategies." \cite{KaplRiba16}

% norm/attitude vs. behaviour:  attitudes towards fgc did not have a positive correlation with their behaviour:  ``within each country women from more developed regions, women who worked outside the home, and educated women were less likely to favor genital cutting and less likely to have their daughters cut. Living in an urban area decreased the likelihood of favoring genital cutting, but it had no effect on behavior. `` \cite{BoylMcMo02}

\subsection{suggestions and Limitations}\label{suggestions-and-Limitations}

% cultural sensitivity:  It suggests that "legislative efforts to protect women's health may remain ineffective with
out structured efforts between health systems, governments or legal institutions and the cultural society." \cite{Iyio12} and 
% through laws \cite{AloGbad11}

% Modernization theory proposes that traditional social relationships and values would be eroded by modernization (e.g., with the improvement of wealth and education and emphasis of individual rights) (see\cite{Moor13}) (and \cite{BoylMcMo02, Youn02}?).

% `` the effectiveness of interventions was hampered by a general lack of information. However, through the realist synthesis we identified that all of the interventions were based on a theory that dissemination of information improves cognitions about FGM/C, but the interventions' success was contingent upon a range of contextual factors. `` \cite{BergDeni12a}

% Education programs aimed to empower women through a broad range of educational and health-promoting activities by improvements in knowledge about and critical attitudes toward FGC had impact on behaviors and attitudes. \cite{DiopAske09}.  Legal measures must combine with social measures to effectively eradicate FGC and communities practising FGC must be involved in the planning and implementation of  intervention of FGC elimination \cite{AkoAwke09}

% attitudes change may be followed by behaviour change, but more slowly \cite{BoylMcMo02}

% \cite{Meye00}:  rational model vs. hierarchical identification model; and plus oppression social context.  That is, knowing ≠ abling ≠ wanting ≠ doing.  How to apply this concept to theories of feminist/gender, modernization and convention.

%\cite{JohaDiop13}:  Some of the most common approaches (1) health risk approaches, (2) conversion of excisers, (3) training of health professionals as change agents, (4) alternative rituals, (5) community-led approaches, (6) public statements, and (7) legal measures.

% Based on our findings, are there any survey questions DHS should have included but did not?  Did our findings see something like group/community identity, womanhood \cite{Koom14}?
% \cite{Koom14}: `` an Aang Serian activist who had addressed a village meeting saying, `The world is changing and the Maasai must change with it or risk dying out.' They argued that these appeals to cultural survival were much more persuasive and meaningful to them than the `foreign' language of rights."

Analyzing why MC is a much accepted behaviour might help us to re-think the meanings of FGC (see \cite{DarbSvob07}) and, if, to certain extent, to accept a form of FGC practice (e.g, a "nick" \cite{Wade11}).

% (Against common belief of a critical mass, an empirical model showed that FGC was not driven by a social norm based on coordination and there was no signal critical threshold for the practice because of various heterogeneity of the population \cite{EffeVogt15} \cf{I don't know if I want to cite \cite{EffeVogt15}.  It doesn't cite some very important papers which had addressed the concerns/questions the paper suggested}).

\cite{BellNova15}: "We find that much of the variation in a woman's support for FGC can be attributed to individual- and household-level factors rather than to village-level factors or to factors beyond the village level."

Suggestions: pricking (type IV\cite{WHO08})\cite{WahlJohn17a, WahlJohn17b} and medical FGC \cite{KimaShell18} vs. no-tolerance, fgc vs. mc \cite{WahlEsse18}?  We suggest to position ourselves in a context where male circumcision (MC) is practices and accepted; to consider the differences of a prick of FGC and MC; to comprehend the outcomes of abolishing FGC vs. changing FGC practices.

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{Conclusion}

%"targeting women and girls is a sound investment, but outcomes are dependent on integrated approaches and the protective umbrella of policy and legislative actions" to change gender norms among women and girls \cite{KeleFran}. 
Reasons of FGC is not universal and different from community to community and from society to society; campaigns of reducing and preventing FGC need to incorporate with local history and believes.
% call for eduction in communication of FGC:  \cite{Koom14, Meye00}}

Eradication of FGC is more controversial than expected.  FGC practice and its nature tended to be morally embraced, and deeply internalized \cite{SchuLien13}.  Decisions on undergoing FGC was often a result of a collective practice than an individual choice \cite{Dell04, Hayf06, FreyJoh07, KandMwek09, Mack96, Mack06, ShelHern06, ShelWand11, YirgKass12}. Public denouncements and anti-FGC laws could push FGC into private practices \cite{GaluKama15, VanCoen17}.  Given the regional FGC prevalence, variations among countries and the social context of FGC practices (e.g., see Burkina Faso \cite{KarmKand11} vs. Nigeria \cite{KandNwak09}), a ``one size fits all" strategy for the abandonment of FGMC would not be effective \cite{JohaDiop13, YodeWang13}.

It is inevitable to compare male circumcision to female genital cutting and question how male circumcision gain its cultural recognition but not FGC.  Considering the acceptance of Alternative rights of passage \cite{GaluKama15} may be an alternative without criminalize the practice. (I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this position, but it is an alternative thought.)

To study types of FGC for the future to understand correlation/assocaition between types of fgc and fgc beneifts.

--- questions worth addressing
1. Is there a tipping point?  Can our findings disclose some ideas on fgc intervention in terms of behavioural change in order to reach a tipping point?
