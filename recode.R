# Ideally, I like to have a variable as daughterFGC (daughter's FGC status) which involves a few variables:  numDaughterFgced (already cut; 95 and 0=none cut), and daughterToFgc.  Those variables provides answers of yes (already cut), no (none cut), plan to cut, plan not to be cut, and don't know the plan yet.  I like to make it a single outcome measurement with 6 levels: yes/to be cut, yes/not to be cut, no/to be cut, no/not to be cut, yes/don't know, no/don't know.

	# make numDaughterFgced as a binary:

	daughterFgced[numDaughterFgced==0] <- "Yes"
	daughterFgced <- as.factor(daughterFgced)

		levels(continueFgc)[levels(continueFgc)=="Don't know"] <- "Depends"
