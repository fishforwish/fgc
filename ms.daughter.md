- Individual woman’s attitude towards FGMC continuity was positively aligned with their community, same as their plan of cutting their daughters.
- The positive correlations were also found in women’s perception of FGMC benefits and their FGMC status, individually and collectively
- The group perception of FGMC benefits was tricky:  it had a clear opposition association both with the continuity and the daughters’ future.
- Gender awareness had opposite effect both on the continuity and daughter’s FGMC future; yet group gender awareness did not see clear association.
- While group FGMC showed a positive association with women’s intention of cutting their daughters, it was negatively associated with woman’s intention of continuing FGMC practice.

Background
=================
\hypertarget{Background}{%
\section{Background}\label{Background}}

Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGMC) (also known as female genital circumcision or female genital mutilation) is a form of injuring female's genitalia for non-medical purposes [Momo17].   Globally, an estimated 230 million women and girls are FGMC survivors, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, and with most cut before age 15 [WHO25].  We use FGMC to recognize both the human-rights viewpoint [UNFP25] and also the importance of being sensitive to the role of identity in making the decisions [Meye00, Onso17, Tost15]. FGMC has been investigated as public health issues and human rights violations on one end [KhosBane17,LeyeVanE19,NabMuul19, TordBish22, UNFP25], and cultural and religious identity on the other [Onso17, Joha22].  While the United Nations has called for FGMC elimination by 2030 [Unit22], progress has been impeded [TordBish22] by its complicated history [BergDeni12, BergDeni13a].  The practice has further been observed via migration in some Western countries where it was banned [Unit22].

Despite various degrees of legal actions against FGMC in African countries, the laws have not been easily translated to abandonment [ChegAske04, Cami15, McCaBroe19, NabMuul19]\cfonly{less cites}, because of its deeply rooted normative expectations [Mack00, Momo17, ShelWand11, SchuLien13].  Understanding its dynamics as a norm is crucial in changing FGMC conventions [BiccMari15, Cami16, CislHeis18, KawoAllw22, Mack96, MataEeke23, Momo17, ShelWand11, Youn15] \cfonly{update}.  Social norm is a form of values driving behavioural patterns which are self-enforcing within a group [Youn15] \cfonly{update cites}, and it is at the core of why FGMC persisted for thousand years of the ancient history [Hayf05, KoubMuas85, Mack96, ShelWand11]\cfonly{update and confirm}.  

Social convention theory, the leading theory probing FGMC tradition (e.g., see [BoylMcMo02, BoylCorl10, FreyJohn07, FrieMahm13, Hayf05, KandMwek09, Mack06, MackLeJe09, ReigGonz14, YirgKass12] \cfonly{update}), initially proposed that FGMC was a marriageability convention through coordination [Mack96], and later expanded to other values, such as social prestige, and adolescent rite of passage [Mack00, MackLeJe09] {update}.  Although the normative coordination was challenged for lack of evidence for a clear tipping point in communities [AgolRich20 EffeVogt15] {update?}, the theory lays a foundation of understanding the complexity of FGMC practice [GutiSola22, Haye05, KandShel19].  The normative theory regards FGMC as a social expectation of interdependent behavior among and coordinated by members in their social network (for examples, see [GreiBarn20, Haye05, KandShel19, MackLeJe09, ShelWand11, WandShel20]) \cfonly{more cites}.  The practice is strongly correlated with social expectation [BiccMari15,MataEeke23] \cfonly{more cites}.  Basically, when FGMC norms within the communities are strong, individuals tend to self-enforce and coordinate such norms [Ajze02, Hayf05, KandNwak09, KandShel19, Mack96, Mack06, MackLeJe09, ThomMadd92] \cfonly{add [Bicc15]]\cfonly{cut cites}.  Normative factors have underlain women’s decisions of having their daughters undergoing FGMC [AlcaGonz13, GutiSola22, Hayf05, Mack09, PashPonn16, Rima08, ShelWand11], whether the decision was a personal choice or an anticipated collective preference of their community [ForsIsak21].

Although norms associated with FGMC behavior have been studied widely as aformentioned, and analyses of FGMC practices using DHS data were also found (such as [AyenWol23, AzezWill20, TordBish22, YounCheo20]), there was limited clarification of quantitative types of individual normative attitudes (e.g., attitudinal position of FGMC values) and behavioural intention in response to the collective persistence.  In this study, we quantitatively analyzed types of social norms women attached to FGMC categorized in DHS along with women's gender-based awareness [GrosHayf19] and their attitudes on FGMC continuity, both individually and collectively. Integrating attitudes towards FGMC continuity and gender awareness when analyzing daughters' FGMC future was relevant to untangle correlation of FGMC norm and intnetion [BoylSvec19, HayfGarv20, Youn04, YounCheo20]\cf{check cites}.  Hopefully, the finding will add a robust understanding of advanced quantitative comparisons of FGMC norms across nations.

\subsection{Data selection}\label{data-selection}}

We analyzed women aged 15-49 from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) when it met the research criteria:  countries with clear FGMC Practice [KoskHeym17, UNIC16], and with FGMC benefit module (see appendix xx for reference).  As a result, four countries of the most recent available datasets were selected:  Kenya 2008/9, Mali 2006, Nigeria 2008 and Sierra Leone 2008 \cfcmt{checked and updated in January, 2025.}. 
The FGMC prevalence in Kenya and Nigeria were over 20\% and Mali and Sierra Leon over 85\% during the time of data collection, which represented the middle-lower vs. high prevalence of FGMC [UNIC16].  
In addition, Kenya and Nigeria were observed a declined prevalence of FGMC, while the prevalence in Mali and Sierra Leone were stably high or increasing [KoskHeym17]. \cf{CF:  to update with FGMC rate.}
Although the dataset seemed outdated, it should not affect the study purpose of understanding FGMC norms and behaviors.  \cfcmt{See https://github.com/fishforwish/FGMC/blob/master/README.md for updated info}. 

This study included only women with daughters for FGMC consideration to make (i.e., whether to intend "to have daughter(s) circumcised in future" based on the DHS phase 5 survey \{https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSQMP/DHS5_Module_Female_Genital_Cutting.pdf, https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSG4/Recode5DHS_23August2012.pdf}).  That resulted in xxx, xxx, xxx and xxx in Kenya, Mali, Nigeria and Sierra Leon respectively. \cfcmt{FGMC module at \url{https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSQMP/DHS5_Module_Female_Genital_Cutting.pdf}}

\hypertarget{Measurements}{%
\subsection{Measurements}\label{Measurements}}

We aggregated quantitative attitude data at a cluster level, as a proxy for collective social norms [MackMone15, RimaLapi15]. The main response was mothers' intention of cutting their daughters, and predictors were mothers' beliefs of FGMC benefits, their gender awareness, position on FGMC continuity and FGMC status.  The FGMC benefits were quantified using average score \cfcmt{pls confirm] to identify the strength of FGMC beliefs associating with FGMC practice.

The co-variables were basic social demographic factors:  country, education, job, residence (rural vs. urban), religion, marital status, age, media use, and wealth.  Media use and gender awareness were also scored.  Cluster ID (i.e., villages where the samples were from) and ethnicity (see the list of ethnicity recode at table xx in appendix) \cfonly{with a footnote on how we recoded it] were treated as random variables.

\cfcmt{ETHNICITY:  numbers of ethnicity groups in DHS:  Kenya 13, Mali 13, Nigeria 11, SL 10 groups.  Is it possible to treat ethnicity as an explanatory variable?  "Some factors that may affect FGMC could not be tested because of data limitations. In some communities, ethnic divisions ... could be influential in the perpetuation of FGMC.... We could not capture these things in our statistical models"[BoylSvec19]).  "For maternal ethnicity, we include all ethnic groups except in Côte d'Ivoire. In that country, the DHS provides a collapsed ethnicity variable combining over 60 ethnic groups into five broad categories.. [HayfGarv20].

The following response factors were also tested at a community level to assess the collective aspect of FGMC behavior:  mothers' intention on FGMC daughters, FGMC continuance, FGMC benefits and FGMC prevalence as well as the following social-demographic factors:  education, wealth, media use, gender awareness \cfcmt{ethnicity or not?}.  Also, cluster was treated as a proxy to represent a community level of impact [AliaRen06, HayfGarv20, KohlBehr00, Krav02].

\fcmt{How do we define community?  Is it based on cluster?} [See GrosHayf19]
\cfcmt{Should we explain how we dealt with a cluter where the sample was too small?}

\cfcmt{Bayesian model [KandNwak09] “Conversely, one cannot assume that the clusters selected in each district are fully representative of the states in which they are located because surveys only attempted to generate a fully representative sample at the regional level. Consequently, the spatial analysis will be affected by some random fluctuations.  Some of this random variation can be reduced through structured spatial effects because it includes neighboring observations in the analysis. However, it should be pointed out that such a spatial analysis should preferably be applied to census data, where the precision of the spatial analysis would be much higher." (p. 788)]


\hypertarget{Statistical-Model}{%

We used cumulative link mixed models (CLMMs) in the statistics package R [Rstats,Rpackage_ordinal] to analyze the models.  The CLMM framework allows us to model a binary or ordinal response variable (i.e., intention of applying FGMC to daughters), while treating clusters and ethnicity as random effects.

\section{Results}\label{results}}

Baseline sociodemographic and sample characteristics are shown in figure x(at fgc_table.pdf in dotdir_gitpush).  The prevalence of FGMC were 31.8\%, 88.6\%, 45.9\% and 91\% of women aged 15-49, and 12.3\%, 47\%, 7.9\% and 80.4\% of planning to have their daughters excised in Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Sierra Leon accordingly.  The main results were shown in figures daugherPlan_effects.pdf and daugherPlan_isoplots.pdf. Basically, the findings showed a clear pattern that the higher FGMC prevalence was, the more likely respondents would have their daughters undergoing FGMC {daughterPlan_effects} which was consistent with the studies aforementioned. While Mali had a similar FGMC prevalence as Serra Leon, Serra Leon had a higher intention of excising their daughters than Mali.  {see figure daugherPlan_isoplots.pdf}.{also look at https://www.fgmcri.org/media/uploads/Law%20Reports/mali_law_report_v2_(march_2019).pdf and SL's legal history}

\cfcmt{to make sure sociodemographic figure showed only the women with daughters for FGMC.]

Basically, after adjusting for individual- and community-level factors, the findings showed robust results, and indicated that respondents’ intention of having their daughters cut was mostly associated with the group intention on this matter in the four countries.  The overall effects of correlation were summarized in figure xxx \cf{daughterPlan_effect and isoplots plot].  The main predictors, women’s FGMC status, beliefs of FGMC benefits and FGMC prevalence were all clearly and positively associated with the intention to cut daughters at the individual level , so as the following factors but in negative associations:  media, and education.  At the community level of effects, the results showed positive correlations with group intention, FGMC prevalence, and media, and negative correlations with gender awareness.  It was noted that the community level of benefit did not show a clear correlation with mothers' intention to cut their daughters, neither did individual gender awareness and rural vs. urban residence. 

The results (see figure _isoplots) also showed that age had a negative nonlinear correlation with women’s intention of cutting their daughters (i.e., the younger a woman was, the more likely to cut daughters); wealth also had a nonlinear correlation, and the highest wealth group was most likely to excise their daughters.

In Kenya, "A daughter’s adjusted hazard of FGMC was lower if she: had an uncut mother who disfavored FGMC, lived in a community that was more opposed to FGMC, and lived in a more ethnically diverse community. Unexpectedly, a daughter’s adjusted FGMC hazard was higher if she lived in a community with more extra-familial opportunities for women. " [GrosHayf19]

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

--Main interpretation --

Based on the findings which rebutted a previous study [EffeVogt15], we believed that FGMC is a social coordinated norm [MakieETC] in the studied countries (Kenya, Mali, Nigeria and Sierra Leon):  an individual behavioral intention is subjected to the normative ritual in their community.  The norm of FGMC is synergistic, based on what women think about other women’s likely position in their community (i.e., likelihood of others to cut their daughters) and values they attached to this practice (i.e., beliefs of FGMC benefits).  We propose that a mother’s intention of cutting their daughters was overdetermined by her community’s overall intention to cut daughters and her personal beliefs of FGMC benefits more than her own FGMC status and FGMC prevalence in the community (see daughrer isoplot x and effect plots x)\cf{Can we use some stat to elaborate our argument?].  The similar coordination also applied to supporting FGMC practice in the future.  The coordinated performance could (or would be?) be a result of subjective norm as perceived social pressure to perform such behaviour or expected choice of conduct [Ajze91]. \cfonly{FGMC is less a coordination rite than singling group identity and symbolism [ShelWand11, Youn15]] \cf{But what is this coordination based on if not marriageability?  What can we find from the benefits PCAs?].  \cfonly{Need to add Hayf05]

Social demographically, compared to a systematic review [AyenWol24], which found that the primary factors promoting the practice of FGMC were family history of circumcision, being a Muslim religion follower, poor wealth index, higher age, and rural residency, our findings showed that.....

That mothers’ beliefs in FGMC benefits was a strong predictor of mothers' intentions to have their daughters to undergo FGMC was well studied [PashPonn16] (more), yet our findings suggested that community’s overall intention on forgoing the practice was equally strong if not more forceful.  When influences from within the communities are strong, individuals tend to self-enforce norms of what the community expect from their behaviours [Hayf05, KandNwak09, Mack96, Mack06, MackLeJe09] (more, Bicc11).  It could be a social norm implicitly supported by social sanction (i.e., cutting daughter) [Bicchieri06, MackLeJe09] (confirm).  The correlation between women’s beliefs of FGMC benefits and group intention of cutting daughters needs further studied to apprehend intentional behaviour and beliefs of normative practice of FGMC for the intervention. \cf{Should the last sentence be in recommendation section?].

Based on our analysis of the benefit index \cf{the 4 countries’ PCA results], marriageability was only one benefit for FGMC, there were multiple factors in influencing women’s decision of cutting their daughters [MackLeJe09] when religious leaders believed that FGMC is useful for reducing the sexual desire of women to prevent adultery and and to enhance hygiene of women [AhmeKare18].  It is likely that marriageability is no longer a strong belief in community where FGMC is still common and new norms are insinuated around [EffeVogt15, ShelWand11, RoveUlri22] (more).  Reasons for FGMC practice could go beyond the belief of marriage prospects and extend to peer convention [ShelWand11].  In Ethiopia, the majority of women who were aware of the negative reproductive health effects had not stopped the practice highlighted the possible fear of isolation and being alienated from the cultural system where FGMC could be seen as a force of social cohesion [YirgKass12].  In Kenya, woman's decision on whether to implement FGMC on their daughters were likely to relate to collective identity within ethnic groups against broader social changes [Achi14, Hayf05]; similarly findings observed in Nigeria [FreyJohn07, KandMwek09].

Regarding community beliefs of FGMC benefits, it had a negative correlation with both women’s intention of cutting their daughters and FGMC continuance:  the stronger the overall FGMC benefits was, the less likely a mother to cut their daughters and less likely to support the practice.  This was against common wisdom [].  One possible explanation is that “it's left over after we include community behaviour. If the community believes in it, they'll probably do it, and then I'll probably do it. But if I \emph{control for] community behaviour, there's no reason to think that community belief is still explanatory. In fact, if I see myself as different from the community I'm more likely to break the norm than if I don’t.” \cfcmt{J:  This is basically your words.  Can you rewrite it?  And I don’t understand the last sentence.]  It was noted that sum of benefits does not equal norm [RimaLapi15]  \cfonly{Need to add Hayf05]

Basically, the norm spectrum spanned from eliminating FGMC due to the violation of human rights to continuing the FGMC practice for ethnic identities [Hayf05, GrosHayf19, Youn02], and ambivalent contemplations of the practice in between [EarpJohn20, GrueEarp20, Joha19, JohaAhme21, Leon20]. For example, if a symbolic "nick" [KoskHeym17] would reach a shared ground.

It is noted that the countries analyzed did not legally ban FGMC practice until 2011 in Keyna [UNIC20] and 2015 in Nigeria [UNIC21a], and no plan of banning the practice in Sierra Leon despite an enacted Child Rights Act [AmeyTett20, Dyer24], nor in Mali [CetoWils20].  In the legal context, the findings showed that.,,,,

— socio demographic factors —

Our models showed that the four countries were clearly different in intention of cutting their daughters with Sierra Lion of the highest likelihood and Nigeria compared to FGMC prevalence where Sierra Leon had the highest prevalence, followed by Mali, Nigeria and Kenya; yet their attitudes of supporting FGMC practice was not clear despite the factor of FGMC prevalence \cf{figure xx and figure xxx].  Regarding sociodemographic factors, education (community), wealth (individual and community) and job (individual) did not predict women’s intention on cutting their daughters, nor did gender awareness (community).  "Autonomous decision-making by women at the community level was associated with lower odds of daughters being cut."[BoylSvec19]

The positive impact modernization [BoylMcMo02, Youn02] and gender/feminist perspectives [BoylSvec19, DalaLawo10, Dell04, FrieMahm13, KandNwak09, Lewi04, Meye00, Njam04, YirgKass12, Youn02] on intention of cutting daughters were not obvious than the convention approach in our findings as well as previously concluded [Hayf05] \cfonly{to confirm]. While a daughter’s FGMC risk was higher if she was in a community with a higher community-level of women’s extra familial opportunities (e.g., education, paid work and marital background) [GrosHayf19], our findings showed that community level of education was not a clear determinant of daughter’s FGMC risk, compare to a previous study showed that community education had no clear effect on the likelihood of daughter’s FGMC future, while the individual education did in Kenya [Hayf05].

Regarding FGMC continuity, education and wealth (both individual and community level) were clearly correlated with attitudes towards FGMC continuation in our findings.  While both wealth level and education of community level had a positive association with FGMC discontinuation (i.e., the higher the education and wealth level were, the less likely to support FGMC practice in the future), individual education had an opposite correlation; the results was compared to what was observe in Sierra Lion where both individual level of educate and wealth were positively associated with support of FGMC abandonment [Sagn14], and to Egpyt [DalaLawo10, VanMeek16]. A secondary analysis of the Egypt DHS from 1995 to 2014 showed a positive correlation of individual level of education, job and wealth with their attitudes of FGMC continuity [VanMeek15] .  It is also important to engage community and religious leaders to understand the need for change and to generate a transformation within the culture [KleiHelz18].  It is also important to think about how FGMC is different from male circumcision and whether a safe medical service is possible [GrueEarp20, Joha22, KimaShell18, RoveUlri22].

It is noticed that the patterns of FGMC benefits based on the PCA results \cfcmt{M: PCA figures] indicated that benefits of FGMC was not as clearly elaborated as the benefit module categorized.  The main index was grouped as others.  It means that the main reasons of why mothers intended to cut their daughters or what they believe was the real benefits/reason was not clearly stated. It could be reasons aforementioned as, for example, peer convention [GrosHayd19CONFIRM, ShelWand11].  Further field research is recommended to further clarify reasons of cutting.

Although FGMC prevalence was a main factor predicting daughter’s FGMC status [BoylSvec19] \cf{more cites], we found that overall community intention explained more variance than FGMC prevalence on respondents’ intention of cutting daughters cfonly{ show daughter effect plot]:  What their community members will do is likely to determine what a mother intends to do with their daughters’ FGMC status. In this case, what people did (descriptive norm?) was less a force than what they will do.  In other words, - descriptive norm (i.e., FGMC prevalence) was undermined by subjective norm (community intentional behaviour of . \cf{One confusing finding is that all the three models showed group FGMC benefits are robustly and negatively associated with the responses.].  Norms sustained through communications and evolve through social interactions [FishAjze10, RimaLapi15].   There are conventional roots in FGMC practice [FreyJohn07, Hayf05, KandShel19, Mack96, ShelWand11] which may evolve into various forms of conventional norms, such as peer convention [GrosHayd19CONFIRM, ShelWand11] (more)

"modernisation-related factors were stronger predictors of abandonment attitudes than of FGMC status" [GreiBarn20] (more), our findings support (or not)?
A systematic review showed that "A lower level of maternal education, family history of FGM/C, or belonging to the Muslim religion (in certain contexts) increased the likelihood of FGM/C. The majority of studies that examined higher paternal education (for girls only) and living in an urban region showed a reduced likelihood of FGM/C, while conflicting evidence remained for wealth. Several studies reported that FGM/C literacy, and low community FGM/C prevalence were associated with a reduced likelihood of FGM/C." [ElFaro22]

"wealth index, education level, history of circumcision, and regional variation are associated with women's attitude towards discontinuation of the practice of FGM in Ethiopia. " [AhmeSeid22]

Norms can be rooted in what one thinks, passively or actively, others think which can be based on one's action or the communication. Change should be coordinated among interrelated members of social networks [Mack96, Mack00, MackLeJe09, ShelWand11]

Data showed that Kenya, Nigeria and Sierra Leon had shown strong progress in eliminating FGMC over the last 30 years, which Mali’s progress stagered [UNIC25].

Regarding ethnicity, "Egypt is relatively homogenous country, both in terms of religion and in terms of ethnicity, while the four countries in our sample are ethnically diverse, and Burkina Faso and Côte d'Ivoire are religiously diverse as well. It is possible that the association of maternal FGMC attitudes with daughters’ outcome varies across communities in complex ways that are not well-captured by the interactions we tested. Further exploration is needed to understand this variation in these more diverse contexts." [HayfGarv20]

\cfonly {in response to the degrees of modernization, conventional values and gender awareness within- and among-community (see [Achi14, BoylMcMo02, Hayf05, KandNwak09, ModrLiu13, Moor13, OdukAfol17, Youn02])}

\cfonly{reference: Methods and the first paragraph of Discussion[Achi14]}

Some women might decide to have FGMC on their daughters even they do not believe the value themselves [ShelResh16]
Research Questions

The social advantages of the practice ranged from showing respect to the authority of the cut elders [ShelWand11], appreciation of the tradition, feminine virtue [WandShel20] and religious requirement [GreiBarn20], to avoiding the ongoing socially psychological discrimination from being denied their group identities [OmigBell22].  FGMC was also viewed as a form of social and symbolic capital [Bour84] to differentiate cut women from the uncuts for seeking inclusion by their social groups [OmigBell22, ShelWand11, WandShel20]. 
 It was noted that the normative coordination was challenged for no clear tipping point occurred in the coordinated communities [AgolRich20 EffeVogt15].

- " the grounds for a growing critical consensus that current anti-FGM laws and policies may be ethically incoherent, empirically unsupportable, and legally unsustainable."[EarpJohn20]
- Involve elders and traditional leaders to address the issue of those who wish not to participate in the cutting practice [ChegAske04, more]

Changes of social norms in public health behaviours may require a few steps:  motivation, deliberation and action [CislHeis18a].  An alternative to FGMC (e.g., a complete stop or a symbolic pricking [WahlPafs19]) will have to provide motivation and facilitate the change of behaviour; the behavioural change will have to be a social action (i.e., gaining recognition and public participation within community) since FGMC is a social norm;  and a public commitment to change in hope for reaching a critical mass needed to dismantle the normative behaviour. (using Tostan as an example) (also see [Youn15].  Promising change are observed in changing norms [EvanSnid19] (and Tostan).  How to foresee a community conducive to certainty for girls without FGMC?

- Based on the results, group benefit did not show clear influences on women's position on cutting daughters nor on support of FGMC practice.  One possible reason might be the validity of the module of the FGMC beneifts which could be overdated.  The newest version of Keyna DHS replaced the benefits questionnaire with questions of cultural and social accpetance.  It will be helpful to study the newer dataset on FGMC norms and behavior.

Unlike foot binding which was displayed in public, the outcome of FGMC can only be identified through private channels (e.g., a tight group community or personnel communications).  The intervention of FGMC via public rejection or condemnation is more questionable (or challenging, especially when if marriage is no longer a main reason for FGMC).  While the comparison of foot binding had a public norm effect, the difference between FGMC and no FGMC is more personal.  A bottom-up campaign empowering local community and engaging women in change of the practice is essential [BergDeni13b] and messages tailoring differences of normative beliefs in different groups should also be considered.  The practice of FGMC is likely to be revised due to types of FGMC, but how to eradicate it if it evolves to just a “nick” [KoskHeym17] compared to the norm of male circumcision as a state of identity [Earp15, HanbEsse21, PalmElme23]?

- MC vs. FGMC.  If MC is an ethnic identity among Jewish community and is overall accepted around the world, can FGMC be granted for a similar value if it is just a "nick?"
Considering the acceptance of Alternative rights of passage [GaluKama15] without criminalize the practice. (I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this position, but it is an alternative.) vs. focused on empowerment, and campaigns to recruit change agents from within communities (to eradicate FGMC) [ShelHern13, Will18]; medicalizing FGMC [LeyeVanE19]
- modelling by plotting empirical data to study threshold/tipping point.
- redesign questions of FGMC benefits in DHS
- inviting faced women migrated to western society to participate in FGMC intervention campaign.  For example,  attitude change: "migrating to and living in Sweden facilitates a transition in attitudes regarding FGMC" [WahlJohn17], and initiating “participatory campaign and education”  (an idea from [MackLeJe09]’s “participatory human rights education” and Boston’s), including women’s empowerment and horizontal involvement (vs. trickle-down strategy)
- [MackLeJe09]”coordinated community abandonments (Dagne 2008, http://www.kmgselfhelp.org/hotissues.html). Both human rights deliberation and coordinated community abandonment are necessary for change. National programmes in Egypt and Sudan are promoting positive human rights messages and discussions at national, regional, and local levels, and are experimenting with a variety of coordinated abandonment through community dialogue efforts at the local level. “ (use [Dagn09, MackLeJe09] for this idea)
- a bottom-up intervention aimed at changing social expectation [BiccMari15]
- Instead of focusing on improving knowledge and changing attitudes, we need to be more cautious about implementation of social norm interventions and infuse intervention in a relational dimension and a dynamic framework [CislHeis18a, CislHeis18b, McCh15].  Empowering local community and opinion leaders in implementing “organized diffusion” [MackLeJe09]has proven cost-effective [CislDenn19]. (and Boston?)

[Cami15]: “ interventions against FGMC, rather than leading to the abandonment of the practice, can have unintended and potentially harmful effects on the way FGMC is performed.”

[NabMuul19]: legal and ethnical background in African countries

- Any questions can be added to the DHS FGMC module to gather more relavent and udpated reasaons why continue FGMC?

-- Limitation --
While beliefs of FGMC benefits was a clear factor associating with women’s intention of cutting their daughters, our findings could not clarify what benefits exactly the women believed?  As proposed that social norm and the behavior it compels cannot be inferred from personal attitude [Mack18] (in rebuttal letter), a further analysis to entangle the FGMC beliefs is expected.

- No FGMC types relating to our response variables

- Not controlling for daughter’s age

- Not considering heterogeneity.
