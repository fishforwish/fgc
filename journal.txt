=================
* To discuss ethnicity

2019 Apr 08 (Mon)
=================

We are:
* going ahead with C.'s new approach
* renaming our response variables and models:
	* daughterPlan is the response for Plan and Hybrid models
	* fgcPersist is the response for the Persistence model
* Change gender to genderAware

2019 APRIL 1
===============
- to make a one-parameter plot first.
Maybe also:
- making a table to show importances of variation in terms of their contribution of effect to responses. an effect plot, a dot whisker effect plot for the one parameter variable.
- revise the panels (e.g., https://github.com/fishforwish/fgc/blob/master/git_push/futurefgcDau_full.isoplots.Rout.pdf) into a simpler one by showing only those with more than one parameters.
- clusters of histogram for threshold: see https://github.com/fishforwish/fgc/blob/master/git_push/prevalence.Rout.pdf


----------------------------------------------------------------------
2019 March 25
===============
- make the score from 0-1 instead of 0-2 
- double check if att variable was changed to gender_awareness = 1-att
- norm is based on what I think you think which can be based on your action or our communication (J said and Chyun agreed).  Chyun will do more literature to make the sense out of our results.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

=================

Current models
* keep only the models with community covariates. It seems that we have enough power to stick to these, and they are also closer to our key questions, so it makes everything simpler.
* Use all three community models. The main one is the full "daughterfgc". We decompose it into two "structural" models:
	* Step 1 "futurefgc" – what do women think about societal values?
	* Step 2 "futurefgcDau" – how do these thought change the main model?

* Replace att variable with gender_awareness = 1-att

Results
-------
Main model git_push/daughterfgc_full.isoplots.Rout.pdf
* fgc status is a strong predictor at both scales (indiv and comm)
* perceived benefit works as predicted, but group benefit has little effect (no clear effect)
	* consistent with group perceptions working via individual perceptions
	* because individual benefit is in the model, we don't see the indirect effect of group benefit, only the direct effect. Not so surprising that there isn't one

Sep 14:

Agenda:

* threshold-style plots

* histograms by country

* look at bene structure, PCA

* draft

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sep7:

Agenda:
* to discuss results of the histograms
	* Added a histogram, we are pretty happy with results

* heterogeneity:  if the group_bene is not clearly detected, what does it mean?  
	* Always tricky to know what ns means. JD is not very concerned with this…

* draft manuscript.tex
	* comments needed
	* Efferson papers

* religion at a community level?
	* Too hard

* What is new in our findings? It is expected that women fgced will more likely to have their daughters cut and support fgc practice.  So what does our finding propose?
	* Shows evidence of binary outcomes
	* Gender attitudes and group gender attitudes
	* Need to look at histograms (or threshold-styles) by country as well.

* make threshold-style plots

* Mike to look at bene structure, PCA

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2018 Sept 3

We did not switch over to tidyverse for this project.
We will start with the recoding step.
Still trying to work on cleaning up refactoring levels and recoding levels.



---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aug 29:

We want all the women, not just women with daughters to be cut, included in the models for the community level of effect.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aug 28:
We looked at the restuls of the three models (3 community levels and 3 individual levels).

We want to exame more clearly about the benefit PCA pattern to udnerstand better of fgc norm
We have to look at the country factor which seems confusing.

We want to have histograms of fgc prevalence by mother, daughter, future and community size.

We will read the science paper by Efferson (http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6255/1446.long) and the one in the Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20100).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2018 Jul 20 (Fri)

* Updated Jun 11 stuff (see below)

* Debated individual model again, decided again to try on different levels

* Decided to not attempt to construct group-level religion (seems too complicated)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
July 19:
* We want to switch to brms (for fgc and mc; and we want to push this method in our projects in general).  
* Use effect plots with baysina.  Since there is no standard way of doing p values, we will not going to do variable p-values.
* p value is twice the probablaity of the sign is different than you think. Jonathan wants Mike to find citation and no one shall argue about it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
July 14:
* Due to all the NAs in the daughter future (individual) model which seems hard to solve and that also questions how reliable our other models are, we decide to do the following:

+ to do profile likelihood and CI for ordinal models?

+ to simplify the model by keeping only media in the random slope

+ If the above both do not work, we will try “brms.”  We will explore "brms" anyway and hope it will solve all the problems in the future.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
14 June

+ Futurefgc and FuturefgcDau ran without problems but daughterfgc_ind *failed* to estimate variance-covariance for fixed effects. Can we bottleneck the daughter model and move on with futurefgc and futurefgcDau because futurefgc and futurefgcDau are the models of interest. How much do we *lose* skipping the daughter model? BB suggest we can extract the hessian from the clmm object and compute the vcov ourselves (daughterfgc_ind). This leads to my next question of how to do *effect* plots. The hessian and vcov have a bunch of extra stuff (ST's) and the effects packages does work with our model (maybe RE's). I can always extract what I need and feed into effects, but not sure if it is correct. 

+ Based on the results of the 6 models (futurefgc, daughter fgc with future, and daughter fgc; each with individual and full models), we will go ahead and do plots, etc. despite the fact that there are still some confusions with the individual daughter fgc model.
+ Jonathan emailed Ben about all the NA and ST in the individual daughter fgc model.
+ Mike will add group mom fgc in the daughter fgc full model.
## 20 Apr 2016

* We want to start with a model that has no group-level covariates. The idea is mostly about power: it will often be hard to see whether a covariate is operating at the individual level, group level, or both: first we want to know whether it's operating at all.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
July 13:
* The higher the score of gender attitude (att), the less awareness of gender equality.  For example:
+ V744E- Wife beating justified if she burns the food:
+ Categories/score: No/0, Yes/2, Don't know/1
* On the other hand, the higher the score of fgc benefit, the more benefits seen of fgc
+ Circumcision benefits - social acceptance: 
+ Categories/score: No/0, Yes/1

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Drafted Jun 11, 2018, updated 2018 Jul 20 (Fri)

* Basically, this paper is about norm and behaviors.
* We studied KMNS: Kenya 2008/9, Mali 2006 (C: the report was in French), Nigeria 2008 and Sierra Leone 2008.

Research Questions:

Main model: daughter plan ~ others (women's attitudes in fgc beliefs and their fgc status).
*  women with daughters to be fgc

Model 2: fgc future ~ others (women's attitudes in fgc beliefs predicting fgc future)
* 2a:  all women
* 2b: women with daughters to be fgc

Model 3: daughter plan ~ fgc future and others (only women with daughter included)
*  women with daughters to be fgc

* All models to be run with and without group-level covariates
	* We said we want to do this for power reasons

Models:
* Daughter plan (main):
system.time(mod<- clmm(
  futureDau ~ futurefgc 
  + fgcstatusMom + bene + media + att + edu + maritalStat
  + job + urRural + religion
  + ns(wealth,3) + ns(age,4) 
  + group_futurefgc + group_fgcstatusMom + group_bene + group_media + group_att + group_edu + ns(group_wealth,3)
  + (1|clusterId) + (1|ethni)
  + (1|CC)
  , data=modAns)
)

* FGC continuity (secondary):
system.time(mod <- clmm(
  futurefgc ~ fgcstatusMom 
  + bene + media + att + edu  + maritalStat + job + urRural + religion
  + ns(wealth,3) + ns(age,4) 
  + group_fgcstatusMom + group_bene + group_media + group_att + group_edu + ns(group_wealth,3)
  + (1|clusterId) + (1|ethni)
    + (1|CC)
  , data=modAns)
)

Decisions:
* This study is about testing hypothesis not prediction.
* We agree on using spline for age and wealth (to keep more power, correct?)
* We used score (instead of PCA) to represent Media use, FGC benefits, gender awareness.
* to include wealth,fgcstatusMom, fgc benefit, media, gender attitudes and education at the community level; and futurefgc in the main model.
* to make ethnicity a random because we don't need the power for the result.  We have enough levels for our reason; and we are not particularly interested in ethnicity for our study.  __BUT__ we latter decided to put it back as a fixed variable.

Basic Information:
* att (gender awareness: no=0, DK=1 and yes=2):  the higher the score is, the LESS aware of gender equality a woman feels.  FGC bene (no=0, yes=1):  the higher the score, the stronger in believing FGC beneifts.  Media use (not at all=0..., almost everyday=3):  the higher the score, the more in using media.
* media scores from 0-3 (3 questions), att 0-2 (5 questions), bene 0-1 (9 questions).

Other issues and questions:
* studying threshold/tipping point: to test if when FGC prevalence reaches certain point, the behaviors start to change (either direction), and if the association of benefit and prevalence also play a crucial role in the "tipping point"?
* Efferson etc's paper (15):  What can it tell us about heterogeniety ("a singel critical threshold is unlikely to exist"). They argued that FGC is not a socially conditined norm.  Will our findings support or rebut it?
* to investigate the associations of women’s gender awareness, and their beliefs of FGC benefits.  It is presumed that gender awareness interrelate to FGC beliefs.  By testing the relations of the two factors allows us to gather information for a better interpretation of the main model. (which group of women?  with or withtout daughers to be cut?)
* to study contrast of countries.
* Who are the women we should include?  So far, we included all women in the fgc continuity model, and only women with daughters who are not fgced in the daughter model.  We have the following variables to consider how we want to make the best use of the samples.
1. G108: Number of  daughters circumcised (we recoded it as y/n)
2. G113: Age of daughter at circumcision (if we wanted to consider only women whose circumcised daighter is under certain age).
3. G115: Any daughter who is not circumcised (This is the main variable we used for the daughter model)
4. G116: Intends to have daughter(s) circumcised in future (This is the main variable we used for the daughter model)
We are also interested in any changes of mother's attitudes on FGC.  We can find information of this by testing women who already have daughters fgced and more to (or not to) be fgced.  This is be interesting, especially at a community level.

7 June

The largest model took 81 hours to fit via clmm. The errors are consistent with the problems noted on May 4th. We have more than one RE and clmm spits back NA's for se.error. Quadrature methods are not available with more than one RE term. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
20 May

Mike has made a beautiful picture, but we're having trouble interpreting some of the details. Should we be worried about the mixing in MCMCglmm? Can we try to address with priors? 

We apparently didn't switch back to ordinal because of something to do with random effects. Can that be overcome? Mike also thinks there's a problem with the quadrature.

We are out spl(age) and spl(wealth) country RE __because of the G/R problem__. Finished all models, running on yushan now.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

May 9th

ML: The reason why ns (spline) did not work the before thus via splines:::ns is because MCMCglmm has its own spline function (spl) and it __claims__ it does orthgonial spline design. I figured out how to do the proposed models from last meeting and now running futurefgc_ind and futurefgc_full on yushan. I still have 4 more models to do (daughter_ind/full and futuredau_ind/full) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
4 May 2018

We don't want to wait until we're able to do multivariate-response models, so we are going forward with a set of "structural" univariate-response models:

futurefgc ~ indiv-level covariates
fgcDau ~ indiv-level covariates
fgcDau ~ indiv-level covariates + futurefgc

We're defining this as the main model

The next step will be to try to disentangle individual vs group effects from these models. The idea will be that if we put in normalized individual-level and group-level covariates, they should compete to explain the effects seen in the individual-level models. We're putting this off a bit because we're not sure how we will visualize this for the multi-parameter variables wealth and age, so we want to see what we can do with the individual-level models first.

Unfortunately, we can't put country back in in this framework! Should we go back to mcmcglmm, but still try to simplify?

One idea, an mcmcglmm model with
* ethnicity, country and cluster all as random effects
* country should be associated with random slopes for all the key variables as well. In lme4 syntax

futurefgc~
  fgcstatusMom
  + bene + media + att
  + splines::ns(age, 4) + splines::ns(wealth, 4)
  + edu + maritalStat + job + urRural
  + religion
  + (1 | ethnicity) + (1 | clusterId)
  + (bene + media + att 
    + splines::ns(age, 4) + splines::ns(wealth, 4)
  | country)

Alternatively, we could use the similar model we already have (with country as a fixed effect with interactions) if we can solve part of the centering problem (maybe simply by using weighted sum-to-zero contrasts on country).

Another option that we considered is to simply do a different model for each country because of this computer problem. JD is against that. ML thinks that these proposals are too hard.

ML will do a better job documenting and sharing important obstacles. Maybe we can overcome some of them.

May 23 2018: (after years!)

There are 3 models:
 
Main model: fgc daughter plan ~ others (women's attitudes in fgc beliefs and their fgc status predicting daughter's fgc future)

Structural model 1: fgc future ~ others (women's attitudes in fgc beliefs predicting fgc future)
* 1a:  all women
* 1b: women with daughters to be fgc only

Structural model 2: fgc daughter plan ~ others (women's attitudes in fgc beliefs, their fgc status and their attitudes of fgc continuity predicting daughter's fgc future)

How about daughters' age?
To find out why did we decide not to use women's daughters who were fgced already.  So far, we can't decide what's the best.
CF:  One of our main interests is community level of effect, therefore all women's attitudes and the fgc status of their own and their daughter should count.  Yet, our main response is whether to fgc daughters or not, so how will this work? 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

July 25th 2016

ML reimplemented all models via brms and all models ran. There was one problematic model (futurefgcDau_full) and the current solution is increase the HMC sample size. It looks a little better. Moving onto effect plots now.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
July 19:

## 4th May 2016
Let's simplify the problem and do the countries separately. The baseline problem is actually a big deal because we don't want to compare against the "baseline" ie. ke.no_job to ml.yes_job..." 
MCMCglmm does not seem to have anova/ something to test variable level statistics, ie, don't have something to test the question "does ethnicity in general affect futurefgc"
Went back and have a better understanding of ordinal and clmm's. clmm (or clmm1) can do multiple RE but via LA and blows up/ spits back NAs for sd.err. clmm2 can do AGQ but only do one RE (back then we were trying to do response AND clusterID and didn't follow up and gave up). 

We can test "norms" now via anova LRT. 

Question: Are we happy? Does it make sense? More validation? Use MCMCglmm vs ordinal? 
* Is there a guideline for baseline?  e.g., ethinicity?

* Can we get medians instead of means in the main summary? If not, where do we get medians and how do we manipulate them?

* Two different (?) things about contrasts and manipulating co-ordinates:
  * Make _prediction_ plots that show the effect of each variable with respect to the model center
    * This is also important for the splined variables, since we don't have variable-level P values (what does it mean that we don't understand what this would mean in a Bayesian context?)
  * Use _contrasts_ to have the main effects show up as _averaged_ over countries
    * BB says that `broom` is "relevant" but not "ready"

* Should we try to make general manipulation tools, or should we be taking advantage of our current Bayesian framework to do stuff the easy way?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

## 20 Apr 2016

* We want to start with a model that has no group-level covariates. The idea is mostly about power: it will often be hard to see whether a covariate is operating at the individual level, group level, or both: first we want to know whether it's operating at all.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

12/04/16

ML will test complete separation problem with just ethni as covariate. It seems to be a problem in both fixed and random effect, not enough time to investigate, check out error_test.R
----------------------------------------------------------------------

11/04/16
ML will remodel the univariate models again via clmm and mcmcglmm.
ML finish making univariate MCMCglmm model, going to refit in clmm
ML I think the problem right now is we added too many covariates into the model. This can lead to (most likely why it is not working for me) is that we are thinning the sample sizes too small such that we have samples with the same response. In theory, and assuming we don't have complete separation problem, we need at last 1 person for each response level. ... complete separation is the next step after this. I tried running all.futurefgcDau.clmm.Rout and not done after 2 hours. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

08/04/16
We found a problem of missing all the women who answered no daughter to be cut in our main model.  So we need to reset our models:
+ The first (or the main) model will be using fgc beneifts and women's fgc status as the main predictors and with two responses:  "whether to cut their daughter" and "whether to continue fgc."  I believe that we already did this one by using mcmc.
+ The secondary model will be using the same predictors (fgc beneifts and women's fgc status) with only one response: "whether to continue fgc".  In this model, all the women (despite with or without daughters to be cut) will be included in the analysis.
+ Regarding the main model (mcmc model), we also need to think about the interaction between fgc benefits and gender attitudes, because we believe that these two variables has a potential "strong" correlation with each other and need to be tested.  Mike said it can be done by coding "bene x att."
+ another confusing but minor questions:  why don't we just put all the predictors in a x b x c x .....?


----------------------------------------------------------------------
06/04/16
Mike fixed the whole pipeline. NA's are caused by incomplete cases and if bene/att/media has a row of ALL NAs. Everything is fixed and can run/fit in MCMCglmm.

Mike's thoughts: It is good we have a big multivariate model, but at the same time, we are throwing away a lot of data. (ie, some countries do not have a lot of data on futurefgcDau). A rough estimate of 60% data are thrown out.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Apr  5 2016

Decided to take a hypothesis-testing approach: more is therefore more.

Decided to stick with splines, because we are stubborn and think they're really a bit better as a way to deal with quantitative variables

Religion and ethnicity are now fixed variables, and we are going to de-nest ethnicity from country.

Mike needs to follow the pipeline and find out why we still have NAs.

C. needs to make a final decision about which community-level factors to include:

IN:

* benefit, fgc, att

Consider

* media, wealth, edu

Arising: do we want to score education, or keep it categorical?


----------------------------------------------------------------------

04/04/16:
ML will recompute the benefit score and check correlation with PC score for all countries. Big model should not be that hard, but we should include another layer of benefit score. ie. individual level/ community level/ country level. This also suggest we should use the averaging (with proper standardization) instead of PC. In theory, this is what "CPC" common principal components are for, but let's not go there.

Everything above is done, now I am going to "merge" the data together (ie combine all the country data together)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
19 Jan 2016: JD, CS, ML



We will try to build a multi-level, multivariate-response model:

women's FGC status; FGC belief 
	--> overall FGC future; daughter's future FGC status

We are starting with four data sets (ke5, ng5, ml5, sl5).

Our next step is to look at PCA analyses of responses about FGC benefit.

We might look into logistic PCA

----------------------------------------------------------------------

08 Mar 2016: ML

We will build the univariate response model first with using clmm2 clusterid as random effect 

Done. now try to do the bolker MANOVA trick. (Is that what we are going to call it from now on?)

I set it up correctly (I think) with random effect (1|clusterId) + (1|clusterId:id) but it is complaining about 
optimizer nlminb failed to converge

Baseline is causing a problem. We can't get rid of the intercept(baseline/contrasting level) it cases a problem in id/obs RE

ML: made an attempt of the bolker MANOVA trick and JD will take a shot at it
multi_fit.R

ML took Bolker's advice and lumped maybes and yes together and fit a binomial glmer.
Still no success but good attempt. Maybe need to look up multivariate complete separation.

multi_fit seem to work, still need to clarify the RE. Going to try logistic PCA next

----------------------------------------------------------------------

15 Mar 2016

Did not try logistic PCA, trying to get a sense of what is going on with RE

Try logistic PCA and don't know what is going on.

Had a meeting with JD and CF, did a lot of code clean up.

Made a mcmcglmm model, but I don't know how to read it

Can't improve the mixing for mcmcglmm. Going to do some simulation with bolker and testing bolker manova trick

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ian suggested trying to fit the model in stan

03/30/16:  
Mike did the statistics of the four countries separately, usig ? model?  
We now lean towards doing a big model (using MCMC?) by merging all the data. The big modle givs us more statistical power, 
but also allows us to compare the differences among the countries.  Some questions remains before proceeding to a big model:
